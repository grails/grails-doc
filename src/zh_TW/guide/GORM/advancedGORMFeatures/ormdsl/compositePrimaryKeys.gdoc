GORM supports the concept of composite identifiers (identifiers composed from 2 or more properties). It is not an approach we recommend, but is available to you if you need it:

{code:java}
import org.apache.commons.lang.builder.HashCodeBuilder

class Person implements Serializable {

    String firstName
    String lastName

    boolean equals(other) {
        if (!(other instanceof Person)) {
            return false
        }

        other.firstName == firstName && other.lastName == lastName
    }

    int hashCode() {
        def builder = new HashCodeBuilder()
        builder.append firstName
        builder.append lastName
        builder.toHashCode()
    }

    static mapping = {
        id composite: ['firstName', 'lastName']
    }
}
{code}

The above will create a composite id of the @firstName@ and @lastName@ properties of the Person class. To retrieve an instance by id you use a prototype of the object itself:

{code:java}
def p = Person.get(new Person(firstName: "Fred", lastName: "Flintstone"))
println p.firstName
{code}

Domain classes mapped with composite primary keys must implement the @Serializable@ interface and override the @equals@ and @hashCode@ methods, using the properties in the composite key for the calculations. The example above uses a @HashCodeBuilder@ for convenience but it's fine to implement it yourself.

Another important consideration when using composite primary keys is associations. If for example you have a many-to-one association where the foreign keys are stored in the associated table then 2 columns will be present in the associated table.

For example consider the following domain class:

{code}
class Address {
    Person person
}
{code}

In this case the @address@ table will have an additional two columns called @person_first_name@ and @person_last_name@. If you wish the change the mapping of these columns then you can do so using the following technique:

{code}
class Address {
    Person person
    static mapping = {
        columns {
		    person {
                column name: "FirstName"
                column name: "LastName"
			}
        }
    }
}
{code}
