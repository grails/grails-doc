A controller handles requests and creates or prepares the response. A controller can generate the response directly or delegate to a view. To create a controller, simply create a class whose name ends with @Controller@ in the @grails-app/controllers@ directory (in a subdirectory if it's in a package).

The default [URL Mapping|guide:urlmappings] configuration ensures that the first part of your controller name is mapped to a URI and each action defined within your controller maps to URIs within the controller name URI.
