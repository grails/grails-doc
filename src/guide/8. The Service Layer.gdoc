As well as the [Web layer|guide:6. The Web Layer], Grails defines the notion of a service layer. The Grails team discourages the embedding of core application logic inside controllers, as it does not promote re-use and a clean separation of concerns.

Services in Grails are seen as the place to put the majority of the logic in your application, leaving controllers responsible for handling request flow via redirects and so on.

h4. Creating a Service

You can create a Grails service by running the [create-service|commandLine] command from the root of your project in a terminal window:

{code:java}
grails create-service helloworld.simple
{code}

{note}
If no package is specified with the create-service script, Grails automatically uses the application name as the package name.
{note}

The above example will create a service at the location @grails-app/services/helloworld/SimpleService.groovy@. A service's name ends with the convention @Service@, other than that a service is a plain Groovy class:

{code:java}
package helloworld
class SimpleService {
}
{code}
