Plugins can be scoped using either the environment or predefined build scopes:

{code}
def environments = ['dev', 'test']
def scopes = [excludes:'war']
{code}

The plugins will only load in those environments and will not be packaged into the WAR file. This allows @development-only@ plugins to not be packaged for production use.
