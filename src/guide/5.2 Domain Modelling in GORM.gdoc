When building Grails applications you have to consider the problem domain you are trying to solve. For example if you were building an "Amazon":http://www.amazon.com/ bookstore you would be thinking about books, authors, customers and publishers to name a few.

These are modeled in GORM as Groovy classes so a @Book@ class may have a title, a release date, an ISBN number and so on. The next few sections show how to model the domain in GORM.

To create a domain class you can run the [create-domain-class|commandLine] target as follows:

{code}
grails create-domain-class org.bookstore.Book
{code}

The result will be a class at @grails-app/domain/org/bookstore/Book.groovy@:

{code}
class Book {
}
{code}

The above class will map automatically to a table in the database called @book@ (the same name as the class). This behaviour is customizable through the [ORM Domain Specific Language|guide:ormdsl]

Now that you have a domain class you can define its properties as Java types. For example:

{code}
class Book {
    String title
    Date releaseDate
    String ISBN
}
{code}

Each property is mapped to a column in the database, where the convention for column names is all lower case separated by underscores. For example @releaseDate@ maps onto a column @release_date@. The SQL types are auto-detected from the Java types, but can be customized via [Constraints|guide:constraints] or the [ORM DSL|guide:ormdsl].

{note}
Always use packages to avoid unexpected behaviour.

* If you have a domain class without package named like any class from package @java.lang.*@ (e.g. @System@) Hibernate will try binding it to the default import and not to your domain class.
* Using Hibernate reserved words (e.g. @Member@) without a package exception @org.hibernate.hql.ast.QuerySyntaxException@ will be thrown.
