There are several plugins that add SOAP support to Grails depending on your preferred approach. For Contract First SOAP services there is a [Spring WS|http://grails.org/plugin/springws] plugin, whilst if you want to generate a SOAP API from Grails services there are several plugins that do this including:

* "CXF":http://grails.org/plugin/cxf/ plugin which uses the "CXF":http://cxf.apache.org/ SOAP stack
* "Axis2":http://grails.org/plugin/axis2 plugin which uses "Axis2":http://ws.apache.org/axis2/
* "Metro":https://jax-ws-commons.dev.java.net/grails/ plugin which uses the "Metro":https://jax-ws-commons.dev.java.net/grails/ framework (and can also be used for [Contract First|http://docs.codehaus.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=88342530])

Most of the SOAP integrations integrate with Grails [services|guide:services] via the @exposes@ static property. The below example is taken from the CXF plugin:

{code:java}
class BookService {

  static expose=['cxf']

  Book[] getBooks(){
    Book.list() as Book[]
  }
}
{code}

The WSDL can then be accessed at the location: @http://127.0.0.1:8080/your_grails_app/services/book?wsdl@

For more information on the CXF plug-in refer [the documentation|http://grails.org/plugin/cxf] on the wiki.
