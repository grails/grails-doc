The @install-plugin@ command is a versatile command that installs plugins from the Grails central SVN repository at [http://svn.codehaus.org/grails-plugins/|http://svn.codehaus.org/grails-plugins/], a local file, or a remote URL.

To install a plugin from the remote central repository, for example the "shiro" plugin, use the @install-plugin@ command followed by the plugin name:

{code:java}
grails install-plugin shiro
{code}

This will install the latest version of the plugin. To install a specific version specify it as an argument:

{code:java}
grails install-plugin shiro 1.1
{code}

To find out what plugins are available use the [list-plugins|commandLine] command.

To install from a URL, simply specify the absolute URL to the plugin package:

{code:java}
grails install-plugin http://foo.com/grails-bar-1.0.zip
{code}

To install from a local file, specify the absolute or relative path to the file:

{code:java}
grails install-plugin ../grails-bar-1.0.zip
{code}
