h1. create-tag-lib

h2. Purpose

The @create-tag-lib@ command creates a tag library and associated unit test for the given base name.

h2. Examples

{code:java}
grails create-tag-lib
grails create-tag-lib book
grails create-tag-lib org.bookstore.Book
{code}

h2. Description

Creates a tag library for the given base name. The argument is optional, but if you don't include it the command will ask you for the name of the tag library.

A [tag library|guide:taglibs] is a "view helper" that in MVC terms helps the view with rendering by providing a set of reusable tags.

The name of the tag library can include a Java package, such as @org.bookstore@ in the final example above, but if one is not provided a default is used. So the second example will create the file @grails-app/taglibs/<appname>/BookTagLib.groovy@ whereas the last one will create @grails-app/taglibs/org/bookstore/BookTagLib.groovy@ directory. Note that the first letter of the tag library name is always upper-cased when determining the class name.

If you want the command to default to a different package for tag libraries, provide a value for @grails.project.groupId@ in the [runtime configuration|guide:config].

Note that this command is just for convenience and you can also create tag libs in your favourite text editor or IDE if you choose.

Usage:
{code:java}
grails create-tag-lib [name]
{code}

Fired Events:

* @CreatedFile@ - When the tag library has been created
