h1. create-controller

h2. Purpose

The @create-controller@ command creates a controller and associated unit test for the given base name.

h2. Examples

bc.
grails create-controller
grails create-controller Book
grails create-controller org.bookstore.book

h2. Description

Creates a new controller with an empty default action. The argument is optional, but if you don't include it the command will ask you for the name of the controller.

A [controller|guide:controllers] is responsible for handling incoming web requests and performing actions such as redirects, rendering views and so on.

The name of the controller can include a Java package, such as @org.bookstore@ in the final example above, but if one is not provided a default is used. So the second example will create the file @grails-app/controllers/<appname>/BookController.groovy@ whereas the last one will create @grails-app/controllers/org/bookstore/BookController.groovy@ directory. Note that the first letter of the controller name is always upper-cased when determining the class name.

If you want the command to default to a different package for controllers, provide a value for @grails.project.groupId@ in the [runtime configuration|guide:config].

Note that this command is just for convenience and you can also create controllers in your favourite text editor or IDE if you choose.

Usage:
{code:java}
grails create-controller [name]
{code}

Fired Events:

* @CreatedFile@ - When the controller is created
