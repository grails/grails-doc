<div id="updateMe">this div will be updated with the form submit response</div>
{code}

h2. Description

This tag creates a submit button that fires an AJAX request when it is pressed. The exact Javascript used to fire off the AJAX request depends on which Javascript library is used. This tag also requires the use of either the <g:[javascript|tags]/> or <g:[setProvider|tags]/> tags. See the [AJAX section|guide:ajax] of the user guide to find out more.
