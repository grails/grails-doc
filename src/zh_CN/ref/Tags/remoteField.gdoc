h1. remoteField

{note}
The remoteField tag and other Ajax related tags have been deprecated and will be removed from a future version of Grails.  Applications may provide their own Ajax tags and/or Javascript plugins may provide Ajax tags of their own.
{note}

h2. Purpose

Creates a text field that sends its value to a remote link when it changes. By default the parameter name sent is called 'value', this can be changed by specifying a 'paramName' attribute.

h2. Examples

Example controller for an application called "shop":

{code:java}
class BookController {

    def changeTitle() {
       def b = Book.get(params.id)
       b.title = params.value
       b.save()
    }
}
{code}

Example usages for this controller:

{code:xml}
<g:remoteField action="changeTitle" update="titleDiv"
               name="title" value="${book?.title}" />

<div id="titleDiv">I'm updated with the new title!</div>
{code}

h2. Description

This tag creates an input field that fires an AJAX request when its value changes (typically when the user presses return inside the field). The exact Javascript used to fire off the AJAX request depends on which Javascript library is used. This tag also requires the use of either the <g:[javascript|tags]/> or <g:[setProvider|tags]/> tags. See the [AJAX section|guide:ajax] of the user guide to find out more.
