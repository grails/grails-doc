You can also customize rendering on a per action basis using Groovy Server Pages (GSP). For example given the @show@ action mentioned previously:

{code}
def show(Book book) {
    respond book
}
{code}

You could supply a @show.xml.gsp@ file to customize the rendering of the XML:

{code}
<%@page contentType="application/xml"%>
<book id="${book.id}" title="${book.title}"/>
{code}
