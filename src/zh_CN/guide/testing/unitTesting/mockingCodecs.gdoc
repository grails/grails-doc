The @GrailsUnitTestMixin@ provides a @mockCodec@ method for mocking [custom codecs|guide:codecs] which may be invoked while a unit test is running.

{code:java}
mockCodec(MyCustomCodec)
{code}

Failing to mock a codec which is invoked while a unit test is running may result in a MissingMethodException.
