URL Mappings also support named mappings, that is mappings which have a name associated with them. The name may be used to refer to a specific mapping when links are generated.

The syntax for defining a named mapping is as follows:

{code:java}
static mappings = {
   name <mapping name>: <url pattern> {
      // ...
   }
}
{code}

For example:

{code:java}
static mappings = {
    name personList: "/showPeople" {
        controller = 'person'
        action = 'list'
    }
    name accountDetails: "/details/$acctNumber" {
        controller = 'product'
        action = 'accountDetails'
    }
}
{code}

The mapping may be referenced in a link tag in a GSP.

{code:xml}
<g:link mapping="personList">List People</g:link>
{code}

That would result in:

{code:xml}
<a href="/showPeople">List People</a>
{code}

Parameters may be specified using the params attribute.

{code:xml}
<g:link mapping="accountDetails" params="[acctNumber:'8675309']">
    Show Account
</g:link>
{code}

That would result in:

{code:xml}
<a href="/details/8675309">Show Account</a>
{code}

Alternatively you may reference a named mapping using the link namespace.

{code:xml}
<link:personList>List People</link:personList>
{code}

That would result in:

{code:xml}
<a href="/showPeople">List People</a>
{code}

The link namespace approach allows parameters to be specified as attributes.

{code:xml}
<link:accountDetails acctNumber="8675309">Show Account</link:accountDetails>
{code}

That would result in:

{code:xml}
<a href="/details/8675309">Show Account</a>
{code}

To specify attributes that should be applied to the generated @href@, specify a @Map@ value to the @attrs@ attribute.  These attributes will be applied directly to the href, not passed through to be used as request parameters.

{code:xml}
<link:accountDetails attrs="[class: 'fancy']" acctNumber="8675309">
    Show Account
</link:accountDetails>
{code}

That would result in:

{code:xml}
<a href="/details/8675309" class="fancy">Show Account</a>
{code}
