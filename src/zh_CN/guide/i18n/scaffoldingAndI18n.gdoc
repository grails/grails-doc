Grails [scaffolding|guide:scaffolding] templates for controllers and views are fully i18n-aware. The GSPs use the [message|tags] tag for labels, buttons etc. and controller @flash@ messages use i18n to resolve locale-specific messages.

The scaffolding includes locale specific labels for domain classes and domain fields. For example, if you have a @Book@ domain class with a @title@ field:

{code:java}
class Book {
    String title
}
{code}

The scaffolding will use labels with the following keys:

{code:java}
book.label = Libro
book.title.label = TÃ­tulo del libro
{code}

You can use this property pattern if you'd like or come up with one of your own. There is nothing special about the use of the word @label@ as part of the key other than it's the convention used by the scaffolding.
