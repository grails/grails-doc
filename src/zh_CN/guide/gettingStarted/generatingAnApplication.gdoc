To get started quickly with Grails it is often useful to use a feature called [Scaffolding|guide:scaffolding] to generate the skeleton of an application. To do this use one of the @generate-*@ commands such as [generate-all|commandLine], which will generate a [controller|guide:controllers] (and its unit test) and the associated [views|guide:gsp]:

{code}
grails generate-all helloworld.Book
