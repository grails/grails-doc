h4. Versioning Basics

Grails has built in support for application versioning. The version of the application is set to @0.1@ when you first create an application with the [create-app|commandLine] command. The version is stored in the application meta data file @application.properties@ in the root of the project.

To change the version of your application you can edit the file manually, or run the [set-version|commandLine] command:

{code:java}
grails set-version 0.2
{code}

The version is used in various commands including the [war|commandLine] command which will append the application version to the end of the created WAR file.

h4. Detecting Versions at Runtime

You can detect the application version using Grails' support for application metadata using the [GrailsApplication|api:org.codehaus.groovy.grails.commons.GrailsApplication] class. For example within [controllers|guide:controllers] there is an implicit [grailsApplication|controllers] variable that can be used:

{code:java}
def version = grailsApplication.metadata['app.version']
{code}

You can retrieve the version of Grails that is running with:

{code:java}
def grailsVersion = grailsApplication.metadata['app.grails.version']
{code}

or the @GrailsUtil@ class:

{code:java}
import grails.util.GrailsUtil
...
def grailsVersion = GrailsUtil.grailsVersion
{code}
