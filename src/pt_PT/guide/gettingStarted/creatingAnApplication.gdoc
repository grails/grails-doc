To create a Grails application you first need to familiarize yourself with the usage of the @grails@ command which is used in the following manner:

{code}
grails [command name]
{code}

Run [create-app|commandLine] to create an application:

{code}
grails create-app helloworld
{code}

This will create a new directory inside the current one that contains the project. Navigate to this directory in your console:

{code}
cd helloworld
{code}
