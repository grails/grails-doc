Ajax is the driving force behind the shift to richer web applications. These types of applications in general are better suited to agile, dynamic frameworks written in languages like "Groovy":http://groovy.codehaus.org and "Ruby":http://www.ruby-lang.org/. Grails provides support for building Ajax applications through its Ajax tag library. For a full list of these see the Tag Library Reference.

Note: JavaScript examples use the jQuery library.
