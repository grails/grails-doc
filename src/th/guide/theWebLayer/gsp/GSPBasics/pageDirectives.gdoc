GSP also supports a few JSP-style page directives.

The import directive lets you import classes into the page. However, it is rarely needed due to Groovy's default imports and [GSP Tags|guide:tags]:

{code:xml}
<%@ page import="java.awt.*" %>
{code}

GSP also supports the contentType directive:

{code:xml}

<%@ page contentType="application/json" %>

{code}

The contentType directive allows using GSP to render other formats.
