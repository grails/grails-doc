== constraints



=== Purpose


Allows the definition of declarative validation constraints. See link:validation.html[validation] in the user guide.


=== Examples


[source,java]
----
class Book {

    String title
    Author author

    static constraints = {
        title blank: false, size: 5..150
        author nullable: true
    }
}
----


=== Description


Constraints are defined using the declarative constraints DSL as described in the link:validation.html[validation] section of the user guide. Once evaluated, validation can be applied through the use of the link:../ref/Domain%20Classes/validate.html[validate] method:

[source,java]
----
def b = new Book()
assert !b.validate()
----

The static `constrainedProperties` property is a Map such that the keys in the Map are property names and the values associated with the keys are instances of http://docs.grails.org/latest/api/grails/validation/ConstrainedProperty.html[ConstrainedProperty]:

[source,java]
----
def constraintsMap = Book.constrainedProperties
for(entry in constraintsMap) {
    // propertyName is a String
    def propertyName = entry.key

    // constrainedProperty is a ConstrainedProperty
    def constrainedProperty = entry.value

    // ...
}
----
