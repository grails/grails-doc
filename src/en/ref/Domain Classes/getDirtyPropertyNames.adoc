== getDirtyPropertyNames



=== Purpose


Retrieve the names of modified fields in a domain class instance.


=== Examples


[source,java]
----
def b = Book.get(1)
someMethodThatMightModifyTheInstance(b)

def names = b.dirtyPropertyNames
for (name in names) {
    def originalValue = b.getPersistentValue(name)
    ...
}
----


=== Description


This method is useful mostly for audit logging or other work done in a *beforeUpdate* event callback. Hibernate caches the original state of all loaded instances for dirty checking during a flush and this method exposes the names of modified fields so you can compare them with the current state.
