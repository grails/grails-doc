=== Description


Hibernate manages persistent instances in a persistence Session. A new Session is created per request and is closed at the end of the request. If an object is retrieved from the Session and placed into a web scope such as the HttpSession it will be "detached" from the Hibernate Session once the Session is closed and discarded. You can use the `attach()` method to re-attach an existing persistent instance to the persistence Session of the current request.
