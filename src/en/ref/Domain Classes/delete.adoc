== delete



=== Purpose


Deletes a persistent instance.


=== Examples


[source,groovy]
----
def book = Book.get(1)
book.delete()
----


=== Description


The `delete` method informs the persistence context that a persistent instance should be deleted. Equivalent to the Hibernate http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/current/javadocs/org/hibernate/Session#delete(java/lang/Object).html[delete] method.

WARNING: Calling `delete` on a transient instance will result in an error

Parameters:

* `flush` - If set to `true` the persistent context will be flushed resulting in the instance being deleted immediately. For example:

[source,groovy]
----
def book = Book.get(1)
book.delete(flush: true)
----
