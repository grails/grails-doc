== hasOne



=== Purpose


Defines a bidirectional one-to-one association between two classes where the foreign key is in the child.


=== Examples


[source,groovy]
----
class Face {
    ..
    static hasOne = [nose: Nose]
}
----

[source,groovy]
----
class Nose {
    Face face
}
----

In this example we define a one-to-one relationship between the `Face` class and the `Nose` class


=== Description


Use a `hasOne` association to store the foreign key reference in child table instead of the parent in a bidirectional one-to-one. The example presented above will generate the following table structure:

[source,groovy]
----
create table face (id bigint generated by default as identity (start with 1),
                   version bigint not null,
                   primary key (id))
create table nose (id bigint generated by default as identity (start with 1),
                   version bigint not null,
                   face_id bigint not null,
                   primary key (id))
----

Notice that the foreign key `face_id` is stored in the `nose` table instead of the `face` table as with a normal one-to-one definition without `belongsTo`.
