== refresh



=== Purpose


Refreshes a domain classes state from the database


=== Examples


[source,java]
----
def b = Book.get(1)
...
b.refresh()
----


=== Description


Equivalent to the Hibernate http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/current/javadocs/org/hibernate/Session#refresh(java/lang/Object).html[refresh] method.

Re-reads the state of the given instance from the underlying database. It is inadvisable to use this to implement long-running sessions that span many business tasks. However this method is useful in certain special circumstances. For example

* where a database trigger alters the object state upon insert or update
* after executing direct SQL (e.g. a bulk update) in the same Session
* after inserting a Blob or Clob
