== findOrCreateBy*



=== Purpose


Dynamic method that uses the properties of the domain class to create query method expressions that return the first result of the query. This method behaves like link:../Domain%20Classes/findBy.html[findBy] except that it will never return `null`.  If a matching instance cannot be found then a new instance will be created and returned, populated with values represented in the query parameters. The difference between this method and link:../Domain%20Classes/findOrSaveBy.html[findOrSaveBy] is that this method will not save a newly created instance where link:../Domain%20Classes/findOrSaveBy.html[findOrSaveBy] does.


=== Examples


Given the domain class `Book`:

[source,groovy]
----
class Book {
   String title
   String author
}
----

The following are all possible:

[source,groovy]
----
def b = Book.findOrCreateByTitle("The Shining")
b = Book.findOrCreateByTitleAndAuthor("The Sum of All Fears", "Tom Clancy")
b = Book.findByAuthorInList(["Douglas Adams", "Hunter S. Thompson"])
----

The following are roughly equivalent:

[source,groovy]
----
def b = Book.findOrCreateByTitle("The Shining")
----

[source,groovy]
----
def b = Book.findByTitle("The Shining")
if (!b) {
    b = new Book(title: "The Shining")
}
----


=== Description


GORM supports the notion of http://gorm.grails.org/6.0.x/hibernate/manual/index.html#finders[Dynamic Finders]. The `findOrCreateBy*` method finds the first result for the given method expression.

NOTE: Because this method potentially creates a new instance and populates properties on that instance, only exact match criteria are allowed.  For example, `Book.findOrCreateByDate(dateValue)` is valid but `Book.findOrCreateByDateGreaterThan(dateValue)` is not.
