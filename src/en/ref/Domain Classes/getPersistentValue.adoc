== getPersistentValue



=== Purpose


Retrieve the original value of a field for a domain class instance.


=== Examples


[source,groovy]
----
def b = Book.get(1)
someMethodThatMightModifyTheInstance(b)

if (b.isDirty('name')) {
    def currentName = b.name
    def originalName = b.getPersistentValue('name')
    if (currentName != originalName) {
        ...
    }
}
----


=== Description


This method is useful mostly for audit logging or other work done in a *beforeUpdate* event callback. Hibernate caches the original state of all loaded instances for dirty checking during a flush and this method exposes that data so you can compare it with the current state.
