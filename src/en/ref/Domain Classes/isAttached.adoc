== isAttached



=== Purpose


Returns whether the domain instance is attached to a currently active Hibernate session. This method is often used on conjunction with the link:merge.html[merge] or link:attach.html[attach] methods.


=== Examples


[source,groovy]
----
Book b = session.book
...
if (!b.isAttached()) {
    b.attach()
}
----


=== Description


Persistent instances are associated with a persistence Session. A new Session is created for each request and is closed at the end of the request. If an object is read from the session and placed into a web scope such as the HttpSession it is seen as detached, since the persistence session has been closed. You can use the link:attach.html[attach] method to re-attach an existing persistent instance to the persistence session of the current request.
