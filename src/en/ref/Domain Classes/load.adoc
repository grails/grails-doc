== load



=== Purpose


Returns a proxy instance of the domain class for the given identifier.


=== Examples


[source,java]
----
// load a single instance
def b = Book.load(1)
String title = b.title
...

// delete an instance without retrieving it
Book.load(1).delete()
----


=== Description


`load` usually returns a proxy for the instance which is initialized on-demand, when a method other than `getId()` is invoked. `load()` only returns `null` if the provided id is `null`, so you cannot use it to test for existence. If you provide an id for an instance that doesn't exist, a proxy will be returned and an exception will be thrown only when you call any instance method other than `getId()`.

If there is an existing instance with the same id in the Hibernate session or 2nd-level cache, load() will return that non-proxy instance instead of a proxy.

Parameters:

* `id` - The id of the object to retrieve
