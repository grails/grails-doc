== belongsTo



=== Purpose


Defines a "belongs to" relationship where the class specified by `belongsTo` assumes ownership of the relationship. This has the effect of controlling how saves and deletes cascade. The exact behaviour depends on the type of relationship:

* Many-to-one/one-to-one: saves and deletes cascade from the owner to the dependant (the class with the `belongsTo`).
* One-to-many: saves always cascade from the one side to the many side, but if the many side has `belongsTo`, then deletes also cascade in that direction.
* Many-to-many: only saves cascade from the "owner" to the "dependant", not deletes.


=== Examples


[source,groovy]
----
class Book {
   String title

   static belongsTo = [author: Author]
}
----

In this example the `Book` class specifies that it belongs to the `Author` class, hence when an `Author` instance is deleted so are all its associated `Book` instances.


=== Description


The `belongsTo` property abstracts the nature of the cascading behaviour in Hibernate. If you want one class to belong to another but not have a back reference, then you can specify a class or a list of classes as the value:

[source,groovy]
----
class Book {
    static belongsTo = Author
}
----

or:

[source,groovy]
----
class Book {
    static belongsTo = [Author, Library]
}
----

Back references, i.e. properties linking back to the owner, can be added in one of two ways:

[source,groovy]
----
class Book {
    Author author

    static belongsTo = Author
}
----

or:

[source,groovy]
----
class Book {
    static belongsTo = [author: Author]
}
----

In these examples, both techniques create an `Author` property named `author`. Also, the Map property can specify multiple properties and types if the class belongs to more than one owner.

The `belongsTo` property is simple and means you don't have to worry about the Hibernate cascading strategies, but if you need more control over cascading you can use the http://gorm.grails.org/6.0.x/hibernate/manual/index.html#ormdsl[ORM DSL]. This allows fine grained control of cascading updates and deletes.
