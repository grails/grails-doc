h2. Description

The @lock@ method obtains a pessimistic lock on an instance, locking the row in the database with @select ... for update@. The @lock@ method is equivalent to using Hibernate's [LockMode.UPGRADE|api:org.hibernate.LockMode#UPGRADE] in combination with the [lock|api:org.hibernate.Session#lock(java.lang.Object, org.hibernate.LockMode)] method.

The lock is automatically released when the transaction commits. In Grails this is typically after an action has finished executing.

Refer to the section on [Optimistic and Pessimistic locking|http://gorm.grails.org/6.0.x/hibernate/manual/index.html#locking] in the user guide for info.
