== where



=== Purpose


Defines a new `grails.gorm.DetachedCriteria` instance that uses a disjunction (logical OR).


=== Examples


Basic query:

[source,java]
----
def query = Person.whereAny {
   firstName == "Bart"
   firstName == "Lisa"
}
Person bart = query.find()
----



=== Description


The `where` method defaults to a conjunction (logical AND) for the created query. The `whereAny` compliments the `where` method by allowing the creation of `DetachedCriteria` using a disjunction (logical OR).

The `where` method is a powerful new type-safe querying option introduced in Grails 2.0. For more information on using the `where` method see the dedicated section on http://gorm.grails.org/6.0.x/hibernate/manual/index.html#whereQueries[Where Queries] and http://gorm.grails.org/6.0.x/hibernate/manual/index.html#detachedCriteria[Detached Criteria] in the user guide.
