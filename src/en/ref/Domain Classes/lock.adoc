== lock



=== Purpose


The `lock` method obtains a pessimistic lock using an SQL `select ... for update`.


=== Examples


[source,java]
----
def book = Book.get(1)
book.lock()
----


=== Description


The `lock` method obtains a pessimistic lock on an instance, locking the row in the database with `select ... for update`. The `lock` method is equivalent to using Hibernate's http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/current/javadocs/org/hibernate/LockMode#UPGRADE.html[LockMode.UPGRADE] in combination with the http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/current/javadocs/org/hibernate/Session#lock(java/lang/Object, org/hibernate/LockMode).html[lock] method.

The lock is automatically released when the transaction commits. In Grails this is typically after an action has finished executing.

Refer to the section on http://gorm.grails.org/6.0.x/hibernate/manual/index.html#locking[Optimistic and Pessimistic locking] in the user guide for info.
