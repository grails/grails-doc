== discard



=== Purpose


Discards any changes that have been made to a persistent instance.


=== Examples


[source,groovy]
----
def b = Book.get(1)
b.title = "Blah"
b.discard() // changes won't be applied now
----


=== Description


The `discard` method informs the persistence context that the instance should not be saved. The `discard` method is equivalent to using Hibernate's http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/current/javadocs/org/hibernate/Session#evict(java/lang/Object).html[evict] method.

NOTE: Note that this method will not clean or reset the object with the original values; it will just prevent it from being automatically saved by Grails.
