=== Purpose

=== Examples


[source,java]
----
// get a list which contains Book instances with ids 2, 1, 3 respectively
def bookList = Book.getAll(2, 1, 3)

// can take a list of ids as only argument, very
// useful when the ids list is calculated in code
def bookList = Book.getAll([1, 2, 3])

// when called without arguments returns list of all objects
def bookList = Book.getAll()
----
