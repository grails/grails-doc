h1. findOrCreateBy*

h2. Purpose

Dynamic method that uses the properties of the domain class to create query method expressions that return the first result of the query. This method behaves like [findBy|domainClasses] except that it will never return @null@.  If a matching instance cannot be found then a new instance will be created and returned, populated with values represented in the query parameters. The difference between this method and [findOrSaveBy|domainClasses] is that this method will not save a newly created instance where [findOrSaveBy|domainClasses] does.

h2. Examples

Given the domain class @Book@:

{code:java}
class Book {
   String title
   String author
}
{code}

The following are all possible:

{code:java}
def b = Book.findOrCreateByTitle("The Shining")
b = Book.findOrCreateByTitleAndAuthor("The Sum of All Fears", "Tom Clancy")
b = Book.findByAuthorInList(["Douglas Adams", "Hunter S. Thompson"])
{code}

The following are roughly equivalent:

{code:java}
def b = Book.findOrCreateByTitle("The Shining")
{code}

{code:java}
def b = Book.findByTitle("The Shining")
if (!b) {
    b = new Book(title: "The Shining")
}
{code}

h2. Description

GORM supports the notion of [Dynamic Finders|http://gorm.grails.org/6.0.x/hibernate/manual/index.html#finders]. The @findOrCreateBy*@ method finds the first result for the given method expression.

{note}
Because this method potentially creates a new instance and populates properties on that instance, only exact match criteria are allowed.  For example, @Book.findOrCreateByDate(dateValue)@ is valid but @Book.findOrCreateByDateGreaterThan(dateValue)@ is not.
