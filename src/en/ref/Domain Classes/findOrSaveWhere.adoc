== findOrSaveWhere



=== Purpose


Uses named arguments corresponding to property names of the domain class to execute a query returning the first matching result. This method behaves just like link:../Domain%20Classes/findWhere.html[findWhere] except that it will never return `null`. If a matching instance cannot be found in the database then a new instance is created, populated with values from the query parameters, saved and returned.  The difference between this method and link:../Domain%20Classes/findOrCreateWhere.html[findOrCreateWhere] is that this method will save a newly created instance where link:../Domain%20Classes/findOrCreateWhere.html[findOrCreateWhere] does not.


=== Examples


Given the domain class:

[source,java]
----
class Book {

   String title
   Date releaseDate
   String author

   static constraints = {
      releaseDate nullable: true
   }
}
----

You can query in the form:

[source,java]
----
def book = Book.findOrSaveWhere(author: "Stephen King", title: "The Stand")
----


=== Description


Parameters:

* `queryParams` - A Map of key/value pairs to be used in the query. If no matching instance is found then this data is used to initialize a new instance.
