== transients



=== Purpose


Defines a list of property names that should not be persisted to the database. This is often useful if you have read-only accessor methods ("getters") that are helper methods but get confused as being persistence-related.


=== Examples


[source,java]
----
class Author {
   String name
   String getUpperCaseName() { name.toUpperCase() }

   static transients = ['upperCaseName']
}
----

Here we have an accessor that takes the `name` and converts it to uppercase. It doesn't make sense to persist this derived value, so we mark it as transient adding its JavaBean property name to the `transients` list.

NOTE: As of Grails 2.0 if there is only a getter or only a setter method, you don't need to declare the property name of the method in the transients list. Only typed fields and get/set pairs that form a property but shouldn't be persisted need to go in the transients list.
