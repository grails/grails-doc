== addTo*



=== Purpose


Adds a domain class relationship for one-to-many or many-to-many relationship, where the relationship is indicated by the property used as the suffix to the method.


=== Examples


[source,java]
----
def fictBook = new Book(title: "IT")
def nonFictBook = new Book(title: "On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft")
def a = new Author(name: "Stephen King")
             .addToFiction(fictBook)
             .addToNonFiction(nonFictBook)
             .save()
----


=== Description


The `addTo*` method is a dynamic method that uses an association to automatically add instances to the association. It also automatically configures the bi-directional relationship so that both sides are set.

Consider these domain classes which are used in the example above:

[source,java]
----
class Author {

    String name

    static hasMany = [fiction: Book, nonFiction: Book]
}
----

[source,java]
----
class Book {

    String title

    static belongsTo = [author: Author]
}
----

The example creates a new fiction book and a new non-fiction book, and an author. `addToFiction` is a dynamic method that works because the `Fiction` part corresponds to the `fiction` collection that results from the `hasMany` declaration, and likewise for `NonFiction` and `nonFiction`. After calling `save()` on the `Author`, the associated `Book` instances are transitively saved too, even though we didn't call `save()` on either of them.

In addition, calling addTo* initializes the associated collections, and sets the back-reference of the `author` property in each `Book`.

There's also a more compact version of the method that accepts a `Map` instead of a domain class instance:

[source,java]
----
def a = new Author(name: "Stephen King")
             .addToFiction(title: "IT")
             .addToNonFiction(title: "On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft")
             .save()
----

This works because GORM knows the type that is being added and can use the standard `Map` constructor to create the instances for you.
