== findOrSaveBy*



=== Purpose


Dynamic method that uses the properties of the domain class to create query method expressions that return the first result of the query. This method behaves like link:../Domain%20Classes/findBy.html[findBy] except that it will never return `null`.  If a matching instance cannot be found then a new instance will be created, populated with values represented in the query parameters, saved and returned. The difference between this method and link:../Domain%20Classes/findOrCreateBy.html[findOrCreateBy] is that this method will save any newly created instance where link:../Domain%20Classes/findOrCreateBy.html[findOrCreateBy] does not.


=== Examples


Given the domain class `Book`:

[source,groovy]
----
class Book {
   String title
   String author
}
----

The following are all possible:

[source,groovy]
----
def b = Book.findOrSaveByTitleAndAuthor("The Sum of All Fears", "Tom Clancy")
----

The following are roughly equivalent:

[source,groovy]
----
def b = Book.findOrSaveByTitleAndAuthor("The Sum of All Fears", "Tom Clancy")
----

[source,groovy]
----
def b = Book.findByTitleAndAuthor("The Sum of All Fears", "Tom Clancy")
if (!b) {
    b = new Book(title: "The Sum of All Fears", author: "Tom Clancy")
    b.save()
}
----


=== Description


GORM supports the notion of http://gorm.grails.org/6.0.x/hibernate/manual/index.html#finders[Dynamic Finders]. The `findOrSaveBy*` method finds the first result for the given method expression.

NOTE: Because this method potentially creates a new instance and populates properties on that instance, only exact match criteria are allowed.  For example, `Book.findOrSaveByTitle(authorValue)` is valid but `Book.findOrSaveByAuthorInList(listOfNames)` is not.
