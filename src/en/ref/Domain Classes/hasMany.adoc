== hasMany



=== Purpose


Defines a one-to-many association between two classes.


=== Examples


[source,java]
----
class Author {

    String name

    static hasMany = [books: Book]
}
----

In this example we define a one-to-many relationship between the `Author` and `Book` classes (one `Author` has many `Book`s)


=== Description


By default GORM will create a property of type `java.util.Set` using the key inside the definition of the `hasMany` map. For example consider this definition:

[source,groovy]
----
static hasMany = [books: Book]
----

Here a property of type `java.util.Set` called `books` will be created within the defining class. These can then be iterated over and manipulated:

[source,java]
----
def a = Author.get(1)
for (book in a.books) { println book.title }
----
