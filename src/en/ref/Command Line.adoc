=== Command Line Usage


Grails incorporates the powerful build system http://groovy.codehaus.org/Gant[Gant], which is a Groovy wrapper around http://ant.apache.org[Apache Ant].

The basic usage scenario is:

[source,java]
----
grails <<environment>>* <<command name>>
----

Grails searches in the following directories for Gant scripts to execute:

* `USER_HOME/.grails/scripts`
* `PROJECT_HOME/src/main/scripts/`
* `PROJECT_HOME/plugins/*/scripts`
* `GRAILS_HOME/scripts`

If multiple matches are found Grails will give you a choice of which one to execute.

You can specify the environment that the command executes in with an optional environment parameter, either with one of the built-in environment names:

[source,java]
----
grails dev run-app
grails test run-app
grails prod run-app
----

Or using a -D argument if the name is not one of the three standard names:

[source,java]
----
grails -Dgrails.env=uat run-app
----

Refer to the user guide section on <<commandLine,The Command Line>> for more information.
