=== Service Usage


A service contains business logic that can be reused across a Grails application. In Grails a service is a class with a name that ends in the convention "Service" and lives in the `grails-app/services` directory. A service can be created with the link:../ref/Command%20Line/create-service.html[create-service] command:

[source,java]
----
grails create-service org.bookstore.Book
----

or with your favourite IDE or text editor.

[source,java]
----
package org.bookstore

class BookService {
    Book[] getBooks() {
        Book.list() as Book[]
    }
}
----
