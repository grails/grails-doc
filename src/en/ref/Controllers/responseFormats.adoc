=== Purpose


Statically defines the supported response formats used by the link:respond.html[respond] method.


=== Examples


[source,groovy]
----
class BookController {
    static responseFormats = ['xml', 'json']

    def show(Long id) {
        respond Book.get(id)
    }
}

=== Description


The `responseFormats` property is used to define the response formats supported by a controller and in turn used by the `respond` method. The `respond` method uses link:{guidePath}/theWebLayer.html#contentNegotiation[Content Negotiation] to respond with the most appropriate content type. See the documentation on link:{guidePath}/webServices.html#REST[REST support] for more information.
