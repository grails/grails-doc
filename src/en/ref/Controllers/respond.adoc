=== Purpose


Attempts to return the most appropriate type for the requested content type (specified by either the `Accept` header or file extension)


=== Examples

// pick the best content type to respond with
respond Book.get(1)

// pick the best content type to respond with from the given formats

=== Description


The respond method uses link:theWebLayer.html#contentNegotiation[Content Negotiation] to respond with the most appropriate content type. See the documentation on <<REST,REST support>> for more information.

Parameters:

* `object` - The object to render
* `arguments` - Named arguments.

Supported `arguments`:

* `view` - The view to use in case of HTML rendering
* `model` - The model to use in case of HTML rendering
* `status` - The response status
* `formats` - A list of formats to respond with
* `includes` - Properties to include if rendering with the converters API
* `excludes` - Properties to exclude if rendering with the converters API

WARNING: Due to the way Groovy works, while responding with a Map and arguments it is important to respond in this manner `respond(\[:\], status: 200)` instead of this manner `respond(\[:\], \[status: 200\])`. Failure to do so will result in the arguments being reversed.
