== scope



=== Purpose


Changes the scope of a controller


=== Examples


[source,groovy]
----
class BookController {

    static scope = "session"

    // ...
}
----


=== Description


Unless specified by the `grails.controllers.defaultScope` property in `application.yml`, controllers by default are "prototype" scoped which means that a new controller will be created for each request.
This behaviour can be set for an individual controller by specifying a `scope` attribute with one of the following values:

* `prototype` (default) - A new controller will be created for each request (recommended for actions as Closure properties)
* `session` - One controller is created for the scope of a user session
* `singleton` - Only one instance of the controller ever exists (recommended for actions as methods)

See link:{guidePath}/theWebLayer.html#controllersAndScopes[Controllers and Scopes] in the user guide for more information.
