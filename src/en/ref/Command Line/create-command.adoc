== create-command

=== Purpose


The `create-command` command creates a new Grails Gradle task and shell command that can be run with the `grails` command from a terminal window.

=== Examples

The command:

[source,groovy]
----
grails create-command MyExample
----

Creates a class called `grails-app/commands/PACKAGE_PATH/MyExampleCommand.groovy` such as:

[source,groovy]
----
import grails.dev.commands.*

class MyExampleCommand implements ApplicationCommand {

  boolean handle(ExecutionContext ctx) {
      def dataSource = applicationContext.getBean(DataSource)
      return true
  }
}
----

The command can then be run with:

[source,groovy]
----
grails my-example
----

Or as a Gradle task:

[source,groovy]
----
gradle myExample
----

Note that the plugin should be on both the build classpath and the runtime classpath in `build.gradle`:

[source,groovy]
----
buildscript {
  ...
  dependencies {
    classpath "org.grails.plugins:myplugin:0.1-SNAPSHOT"
  }
  ...
  dependencies {
    runtime "org.grails.plugins:myplugin:0.1-SNAPSHOT"
  }
}
----



=== Description


In order to separate the code generation and build layer, in Grails 3.x scripts created with `create-script` do not have access to the running application instance.

Instead, Grails 3.x features a new concept called an http://docs.grails.org/latest/api/grails/dev/commands/ApplicationCommand.html[ApplicationCommand] that is invoked via Gradle to perform tasks such as interact with the database etc.
