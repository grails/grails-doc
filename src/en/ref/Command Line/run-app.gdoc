h1. run-app

h2. Purpose

Runs a Grails application in an embedded servlet container

{warning}
This target is _not_ intended to be used for application deployment. There are many optimizations implemented when  generating a WAR file for deployment that are not available to @run-app@ since @run-app@ is optimized for developer productivity, not performance.
{warning}

h2. Examples

{code:java}
grails run-app
grails run-app -https // with HTTPS
grails test run-app
grails -Dserver.port=8090 -Denable.jndi=true -Ddisable.auto.recompile=true run-app
{code}

h2. Description

Usage:
{code:java}
grails [env]* run-app
{code}

Arguments:

* @https@ - Start an HTTPS server (on port 8443 by default) alongside the main server. Just to be clear, the application will be accessible via HTTPS _and_ HTTP. A self-signed key will be generated. Intended for development use only.

Supported system properties:

* @disable.auto.recompile@ - Disables auto-recompilation of Java sources, which can be processor intensive (defaults to @false@)
* @recompile.frequency@ - Specifies how frequently (in seconds) Grails checks for changes to Java and Groovy sources in your project (defaults to 3).
* @grails.server.port.http@/@server.port@ - Specifies the HTTP port to run the server on (defaults to 8080)
* @grails.server.port.https@ - Specifies the HTTPS port to run the server on (defaults to 8443)
* @grails.server.host@/@server.host@ - Specifies the host name to run the server on (defaults to localhost)

Fired Events:

* @StatusFinal@ - When the container has been started
* @StatusUpdate@ - When the container is reloading

This command starts Grails in an embedded servlet container that can serve HTTP requests. The default container is "Tomcat":http://tomcat.apache.org but alternative containers are supported via the plugin system. For example to run Grails with Jetty run the following two commands:

{code}
grails uninstall-plugin tomcat
grails install-plugin jetty
{code}
