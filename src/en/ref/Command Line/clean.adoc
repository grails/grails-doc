== clean



=== Purpose


The `clean` command deletes all compiled resources from the application. Since Groovy is a compiled language, as with Java, this is sometimes useful to clear old instances of classes and ensure correct compilation. It's also a good idea to run this script before running tests or creating a WAR file to ensure a full compilation occurs.
