== docs



=== Purpose


Generates a user guide and Javadoc + Groovydoc API documentation for the current Grails project.


=== Examples


Add the plugin in your `build.gradle`:

[source,groovy]
----
apply plugin: "org.grails.grails-doc"
----

Now run the command

[source,groovy]
----
gradle docs
----


=== Description


Some projects, particular plugins, benefit from documentation explaining how they work. Grails comes with its own <<docengine,documentation engine>> based on a wiki syntax that can generate both HTML and PDF versions of a user guide, just like the one you are currently reading. If you have the source for a user guide in `src/docs`, then this command will automatically generate the corresponding HTML and PDF documents.

It's often useful to have API documentation as well. Since Grails is a mixed source framework, the command also generates both http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/index-137868.html[Javadoc] (the standard format for Java documentation) and Groovydoc API references in HTML form.

The documentation is generated to the following directories:

* `docs/api` - Location of javadoc comments
* `docs/gapi` - Location of groovydoc comments
* `docs/guide` - Location of the user guide
* `docs/ref` - Location of the reference section of the user guide

Usage:
[source,java]
----
grails doc
----

Arguments:

* `\--init` - Create a template project documentation project (optional)
* `\--pdf` - Create PDF output for project documentation (optional)

Fired Events:

* `DocStart` - Before documentation generation begins
* `DocEnd` - After documentation generation completes
