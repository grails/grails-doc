== test-app



=== Purpose


Runs all Grails unit and integration tests and generates reports. The command returns appropriate response codes for embedding with continuous integration servers.


=== Examples


[source,java]
----
grails test-app
grails test-app Foo
grails test-app Foo Bar
----


=== Description


Usage:
[source,java]
----
grails <<environment>>* test-app <<names>>*
----

Fired Events:

* `StatusFinal` - When the test cycle completes

Executes the Grails unit and integration tests located in the `test/unit` and `test/integration` directories. By default all tests are executed, but you can specify the names of the tests (without the "Tests" or other test type suffix) as argument to the command:

[source,java]
----
grails test-app Foo
grails test-app Foo Bar
----

The first example will execute a test called `FooTests.groovy` whilst the second will execute `FooTests.groovy` and `BarTests.groovy` if they exist.

NOTE: Tests can also use the suffix of `Test` instead of `Tests`.

You can also choose to only run the unit or integration tests:

[source,java]
----
grails test-app -unit
grails test-app -integration
----

If you only wish to re-run failed tests use the -rerun flag

[source,java]
----
grails test-app -rerun
----

See the link:testing.html[Testing] section for examples on how to combine the different options to target tests.
