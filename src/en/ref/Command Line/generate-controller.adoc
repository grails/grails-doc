== generate-controller



=== Purpose


Generates a controller and associated unit test for the given domain class


=== Examples


[source,java]
----
grails generate-controller
grails generate-controller org.bookstore.Book
grails generate-controller "\*"
----


=== Description


Grails supports a feature known as static scaffolding which involves the generation of a CRUD (Create/Read/Update/Delete) interface for a given domain class. Once generated, the controller and its views can be modified by you but they won't automatically update when you change the domain class.

The `generate-controller` command generates just the controller (and associated unit test) that implements CRUD for the given domain class. The argument is optional, but if you don't include it the command will ask you for the name of the domain class to scaffold. So for a domain class `org.bookstore.Book`, this command will generate the controller `BookController.groovy` in `grails-app/controllers/org/bookstore`.

Usage:
[source,java]
----
grails generate-controller <<domain class name>>
----

Fired Events:

* `StatusUpdate` - When generation begins
* `StatusFinal` - When generation completes

Arguments:

* `domain class name` - Either a domain class name (case-sensitive) or a wildcard (\*). If you specify the wildcard controllers will be generated for _all_ domain classes.

Flags:

* `force` - Whether to overwrite existing files
