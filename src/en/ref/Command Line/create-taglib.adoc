== create-taglib

=== Purpose

The `create-taglib` command creates a tag library and associated unit test for the given base name.

=== Examples

[source,groovy]
----
grails create-taglib
grails create-taglib book
grails create-taglib org.bookstore.Book
----

=== Description

Creates a tag library for the given base name. The argument is optional, but if you don't include it the command will ask you for the name of the tag library.

A link:{guidePath}/theWebLayer.html#taglibs[tag library] is a "view helper" that in MVC terms helps the view with rendering by providing a set of reusable tags.

The name of the tag library can include a Java package, such as `org.bookstore` in the final example above, but if one is not provided a default is used. So the second example will create the file `grails-app/taglibs/<appname>/BookTagLib.groovy` whereas the last one will create `grails-app/taglibs/org/bookstore/BookTagLib.groovy` directory. Note that the first letter of the tag library name is always upper-cased when determining the class name.

If you want the command to default to a different package for tag libraries, provide a value for `grails.project.groupId` in the link:{guidePath}/conf.html[runtime configuration].

Note that this command is just for convenience and you can also create tag libs in your favourite text editor or IDE if you choose.

Usage:
[source,groovy]
----
grails create-taglib <<name>>
----
