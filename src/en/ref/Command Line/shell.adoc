=== Description


Usage:
[source,groovy]
----
grails <<environment>>* shell
----

Starts the Grails shell, which is an extended version of the regular Groovy shell. Within the binding of the shell there are a couple of useful variables:

* `ctx` - The Spring ApplicationContext instance
* `grailsApplication` - The GrailsApplication instance

These are useful as they allow access to the conventions within Grails and Spring beans.

Example Shell:

[source,groovy]
----
Groovy Shell (1.8.0, JVM: 1.6.0_26)
Type 'help' or '\h' for help.
