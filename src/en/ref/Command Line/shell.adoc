Starts the Grails shell, which is an extended version of the regular Groovy shell. Within the binding of the shell there are a couple of useful variables:

* `ctx` - The Spring ApplicationContext instance
* `grailsApplication` - The GrailsApplication instance

These are useful as they allow access to the conventions within Grails and Spring beans.

Fired Events:

* `StatusFinal` - When the shell is loaded
