== create-service

=== Purpose

The `create-service` command creates a Grails service class and associated unit test for the given base name.

=== Examples

[source,java]
----
grails create-service
grails create-service book
grails create-service org.bookstore.Book
----

=== Description

Creates a service for the given base name. The argument is optional, but if you don't include it the command will ask you for the name of the service.

A <<services,service>> encapsulates business logic and is delegated to by controllers to perform the core logic of a Grails application.

The name of the service can include a Java package, such as `org.bookstore` in the final example above, but if one is not provided a default is used. So the second example will create the file `grails-app/service/<appname>/BookService.groovy` whereas the last one will create `grails-app/services/org/bookstore/BookService.groovy` directory. Note that the first letter of the service name is always upper-cased when determining the class name.

If you want the command to default to a different package for services, provide a value for `grails.project.groupId` in the <<config,runtime configuration>>.

Note that this command is just for convenience and you can also create services in your favorite text editor or IDE if you choose.

Usage:

[source,java]
----
grails create-service <<name>>
----
