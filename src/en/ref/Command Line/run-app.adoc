== run-app

=== Purpose

Runs a Grails application in an embedded servlet container

WARNING: This target is _not_ intended to be used for application deployment. There are many optimizations implemented when  generating a WAR file for deployment that are not available to `run-app` since `run-app` is optimized for developer productivity, not performance.

=== Examples

[source,groovy]
----
grails run-app
grails run-app -https // with HTTPS
grails test run-app
----

=== Description

Usage:

[source,groovy]
----
grails <<env>>* run-app
----

Arguments:

* `debug-jvm` - Run the application using a debug JVM (port 5005) in order to attach a remote debugger.
* `port` - The port to use
* `host` - The host to bind to
* `https` - Start an HTTPS server (on port 8443 by default) alongside the main server. Just to be clear, the application will be accessible via HTTPS _and_ HTTP. A self-signed key will be generated. Intended for development use only.

Supported system properties:

* `grails.server.port.http`/`server.port` - Specifies the HTTP port to run the server on (defaults to 8080)
* `grails.server.port.https` - Specifies the HTTPS port to run the server on (defaults to 8443)
* `grails.server.host`/`server.host` - Specifies the host name to run the server on (defaults to localhost)


This command starts Grails in an embedded servlet container that can serve HTTP requests. The default container is http://tomcat.apache.org[Tomcat] but alternative containers are supported by altering the Spring boot starter in `build.gradle`.

[source,groovy]
----
// use Jetty
runtime "org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-jetty"
