== create-integration-test

=== Purpose

The `create-integration-test` command creates an integration test for the given base name.

=== Examples

[source,java]
----
grails create-integration-test
grails create-integration-test book
grails create-integration-test org.bookstore.Book
----

=== Description

Creates an integration test for the given base name. The argument is optional, but if you don't include it the command will ask you for the name of the controller.

An integration test differs from a unit test in that the Grails environment is loaded for each test execution. Refer to the section on <<testing,Unit Testing>> of the user guide for information on unit vs. integration testing.

The name of the test can include a Java package, such as `org.bookstore` in the final example above, but if one is not provided a default is used. So the second example will create the file `test/integration/<appname>/BookSpec.groovy` whereas the last one will create `test/integration/org/bookstore/BookSpec.groovy` directory. Note that the first letter of the test name is always upper-cased when determining the class name.

If you want the command to default to a different package for tests, provide a value for `grails.project.groupId` in the <<config,runtime configuration>>.

Note that this command is just for convenience and you can also create integration tests in your favourite text editor or IDE if you choose.

Usage:
[source,java]
----
grails create-integration-test <<name>>
