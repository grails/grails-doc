=== Purpose


The core plugin adds methods and beans that other plugins rely upon


=== Description


This plugin configures Grails to use Spring MVC at its core to deal with web requests. The plugin configures the `GrailsDispatcherServlet` and necessary Spring beans (see below) for controllers, tag libraries and Groovy Server Pages (GSP)

Configured Spring Beans:

* `classLoader` - A bean that refers to the GroovyClassLoader used to load this GrailsApplication
* `classEditor` - A PropertyEditor that populates classes with String data
* `customEditors` - An instance of http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/config/CustomEditorConfigurer.html[CustomEditorConfigurer], that uses allows the `classEditor` bean to be used as a `PropertyEditor`
