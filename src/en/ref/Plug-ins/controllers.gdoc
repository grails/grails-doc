h1. controllers

h2. Purpose

A plugin that configures core Grails MVC architecture using the underlying Spring MVC component model

h2. Examples

A controller:

{code}
class BookController {
    def list() {
        [books:Book.list()]
    }
}
{code}

A tag library:

{code}
import java.text.SimpleDateFormat

class FormatTagLib {
    def dateFormat = { attrs ->
        out << new SimpleDateFormat(attrs.format).format(attrs.value)
    }
}
{code}

h2. Description

This plugin configures Grails to use Spring MVC at its core to deal with web requests. The plugin sets up the @GrailsDispatcherServlet@ and necessary Spring beans (see below) for controllers, tag libraries and Groovy Server Pages (GSP)

Configured Spring Beans:

* @exceptionHandler@ - An instance of [GrailsExceptionResolver|api:org.grails.web.errors.GrailsExceptionResolver] for dealing with exceptions
* @multipartResolver@ - An instance of [CommonsMultipartResolver|api:org.springframework.web.multipart.commons.CommonsMultipartResolver] used for dealing with file uploads using Apache Commons File Upload. If you do not wish to use this, set grails.disableCommonsMultipart to true in @application.groovy@. Be aware that disabling multipart handling will effect the behaviour of g:actionSubmit which needs to inspect the parameters (requiring the multipart request to be parsed) during the URL mapping phase.
* @groovyPageResourceLoader@ - Configured in @development@ mode only or when the @grails.gsp.view.dir@ is set. This is a Spring ResourceLoader that knows how to load GSP views from the an arbitrary location
* @groovyPagesTemplateEngine@ - An instance of [GroovyPagesTemplateEngine|api:org.grails.gsp.GroovyPagesTemplateEngine], this class deals with rendering of GSP views
* @jspViewResolver@ - An instance of [GrailsViewResolver|api:org.grails.web.servlet.view.GrailsViewResolver] that knows how to resolve GSP views and is environment aware

The plugin also configures each Grails controller class as a prototyped Spring bean and each Grails tag library as a singleton Spring bean
