== domainClass



=== Purpose


The `domainClass` plugin configures Grails domain classes as prototyped beans in the Spring `ApplicationContext`


=== Examples


An example domain class:

[source,groovy]
----
class Book {
    String title
    Date releaseDate
    Author author
}
----


=== Description


Refer to the section on link:http://gorm.grails.org/6.0.x/hibernate/manual/[GORM] in the Grails user guide which details how to create Grails domain classes.

Configured Spring Beans given a domain class of `Book`:

* `BookValidator` - A {apiDocs}org/grails/validation/GrailsDomainClassValidator.html[GrailsDomainClassValidator] that validates a domain class' defined link:validation.html#constraints[Constraints].
* `BookPersistentClass` - The `Class` for the domain class `Book`
* `BookDomainClass` - The {apiDocs}grails/core/GrailsDomainClass.html[GrailsDomainClass] instance which understands the conventions defined within a domain class and is used by link:../../guide/GORM.html[GORM] to perform ORM mapping.
* `Book` - A prototyped bean that will create a new instance of `Book` every time requested. This bean is used to perform auto-wiring of domain classes when constructed with the `new` operator.
