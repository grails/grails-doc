== unless



=== Purpose


Renders its body conditionally, based on an expression and/or current environment. The tag renders its body unless all of the specified conditions (test and/or environment) are `true`. Does the opposite of what the link:../ref/Tags/if.html[if] tag does.


=== Examples


[source,xml]
----
<g:unless test="${name == 'fred'}">
    Hello ${name}!
</g:unless>

<g:unless env="production">
    debug: $someDebug
</g:unless>

<g:unless env="production" test="${cacheEnabled}">
    $cache.getContent('1234')
</g:unless>
----


=== Description


Attributes

* `test` - The expression to test
* `env` - An environment name

At least one of the attributes must be supplied. If both are supplied, they are combined using AND.
