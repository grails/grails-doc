== javascript



=== Purpose


Includes JavaScript libraries and scripts as well as providing a shorthand for inline JavaScript.


=== Examples


[source,xml]
----
// actually imports '/app/js/myscript.js'
<g:javascript src="myscript.js" />

<g:javascript>alert('hello')</g:javascript>
----


=== Description


If you do not include a "src" attribute but instead provide a body, the result is an inline script.

If you use this tag to render inline JavaScript code, it is recommended that you use the Resources plugin's <r:script> tag to produce inline script that is included at the end of the body, or in the head if necessary - rather than inline. For more control use the Resources plugin's http://grails-plugins.github.com/grails-resources/ref/Tags/script.html[<r:script>] tag directly.

Attributes

* `contextPath` (optional) - the context path to use (relative to the application context path). Defaults to "" or path to the plugin for a plugin view or template.
* `src` (optional) - The name of the JavaScript file to import. Will look in /appname/js directory
* `plugin` (optional) - The plugin to look for the JavaScript in
