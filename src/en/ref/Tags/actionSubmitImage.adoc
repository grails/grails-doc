=== Examples

----
<g:actionSubmitImage value="Update" action="update"
                     src="${resource(dir: 'images', file: 'update.gif')}" />
----


=== Description


Attributes

* `value` - The caption of the button and name of action when not explicitly defined
* `src` - The source of the image to use
* `action` (optional) - The name of the action to be executed

WARNING: You cannot use multiple actionSubmitImage tags within the same form and have it work in Internet Explorer 6 or 7 unless you add some custom JavaScript. See http://www.quirksmode.org/bugreports/archives/2006/07/Namevalue_pairs_arent_submitted_for_image_submit_b.html[this page] for a bit more information and a workaround.
