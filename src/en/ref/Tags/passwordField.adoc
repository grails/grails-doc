== passwordField



=== Purpose


Creates a input of type 'password' (a password field). An implicit "id" attribute is given the same value as name unless you explicitly specify one.


=== Examples


[source,xml]
----
<g:passwordField name="myPasswordField" value="${myPassword}" />
----


=== Description


Attributes

* `name` (required) - The name of the password field
* `value` (optional) - The value of the password field


=== Configuration


Some attributes can be defined as Boolean values, but the html specification
mandates the attribute must have the same value as its name. For example,
`disabled`, `readonly` and `checked`. It may be desirable to have additional attributes
(like `required`) behave the same way. This can be controlled with the following config value:

[source,yml]
----
grails:
    tags:
        booleanToAttributes:
            - disabled
            - checked
            - readonly
            - required
----

Defaults are `disabled`, `checked`, `readonly`
