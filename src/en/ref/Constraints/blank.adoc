== blank



=== Purpose


Validates that a String value is not blank (i.e. contains non-whitespace chracters).


=== Examples


[source,groovy]
----
login blank: false
----


=== Description


Set to `false` if a string value cannot be blank.

Error Code: `className.propertyName.blank`

NOTE: If the string is `null`, it won't validate with `blank: true`. In this case, set the link:nullable.html[nullable] constraint to `true`.

NOTE: If the string contains whitespace (tabs or spaces), it is still considered blank. Use `minSize:1` if you want to make sure the string is not empty.
