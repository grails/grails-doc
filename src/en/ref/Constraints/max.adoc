=== max



=== Purpose


Ensures a value does not exceed a maximum value.


=== Examples


[source,java]
----
age max: new Date()
price max: 999F
----


=== Description


Sets the maximum value of a class that implements `java.lang.Comparable`. The type of the value must be the same as the property.

Note that constraints are only evaluated once which may be relevant for a constraint that relies on a value like an instance of `java.util.Date`.

[source,java]
----
class User {
    ...

    static constraints = {
        // this Date object is created when the constraints are evaluated, not
        // each time an instance of the User class is validated.
        birthDate max: new Date()
    }
}
----

This constraint influences <<gormConstraints,schema generation>>.

Error Code: `className.propertyName.max.exceeded`
