== bindable



=== Purpose


Configure the bindability of a property.


=== Examples


[source,java]
----
salary bindable: false
firstName size: 5..15, bindable: true
department bindable: true
----


=== Description


Set to `false` to indicate that a property is not to be automatically assigned a value during data binding.

[source,groovy]
----
package com.demo

class Employee {
    String firstName
    String department
    BigDecimal salary

    static constraints = {
        department bindable: false
        salary bindable: false
    }
}
----

[source,groovy]
----
import com.demo.Employee

def employee = new Employee()
employee.firstName = 'Bill'
employee.department = 'Percussion'
employee.salary = 42.0

// department and salary will NOT be bound because they are configured as non-bindable in the Employee.constraints closure
employee.properties = [firstName: 'William',
                       department: 'Retired',
                       salary: 99.99]

assert 'William' == employee.firstName
assert 'Percussion' == employee.department
assert 42.0 == employee.salary
----

Statically typed instance properties are bindable by default.  Properties which are not bindable by default are those related to transient fields, dynamically typed properties and static properties.

See the link:theWebLayer.html#dataBinding[data binding] section for more details on data binding.

NOTE: The bindable constraint must be assigned a literal boolean value.  Dynamic expressions are not valid values for the bindable constraint.  The value must be the literal `true` or `false`.

The bindable constraint must be applied in the constraints closure which is defined in the relevant class.  This means that bindable may not be used as a shared constraint.
