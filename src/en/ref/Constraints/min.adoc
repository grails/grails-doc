== min



=== Purpose


Ensures a value does not fall below a minimum value.


=== Examples


[source,groovy]
----
age min: new Date()
price min: 0F
----


=== Description


Sets the minimum value of a class that implements `java.lang.Comparable`. The type of the value must be the same as the property.

Note that constraints are only evaluated once which may be relevant for a constraint that relies on a value like an instance of `java.util.Date`.

[source,groovy]
----
class User {
    ...

    static constraints = {
        // this Date object is created when the constraints are evaluated, not
        // each time an instance of the User class is validated.
        age min: new Date()
    }
}
----

This constraint influences http://gorm.grails.org/6.0.x/hibernate/manual/index.html#constraints[schema generation].

Error Code: `className.propertyName.min.notmet`
