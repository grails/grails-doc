== attributes



=== Purpose


Adds custom attributes to scaffolding tags.


=== Examples


[source,java]
----
birthDate attributes: [years: 2000..2011]
----


=== Description


Adds extra attributes to the GSP tag used to display the edit field for the specified domain class property. For example, the rendered tag in scaffolding for the `birthDate` property above would look like:

[source,xml]
----
<g:datePicker name="birthDate" ... years="2000..2011" ... />
----

Hence, the scaffolded view would limit a user to the years 2000-2011, as dictated by the g:datePicker tag.

NOTE: This constraint only works for boolean (checkbox), date (datePicker), and collection (*select) properties.

Error Code: This constraint only impacts the scaffolding and does not create errors.
