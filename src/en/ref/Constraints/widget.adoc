== widget



=== Purpose


Changes the HTML form field type used in scaffolding the associated domain class property.


=== Examples


[source,java]
----
description widget: 'textarea'
----


=== Description


Changes the GSP tag used for editing values of the corresponding domain class property in the scaffolding. For example, the above would cause the scaffolding to use `<g:textArea ... />` for 'description' edit fields.

NOTE: This constraint is also added to scaffolding tags for boolean (checkbox), date (datePicker), and collection (*select) properties, but it has no effect in those cases.

Error Code: This constraint only impacts look and does not create errors.
