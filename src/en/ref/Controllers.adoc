=== Controller Usage


A controller fulfills the C in the Model View Controller (MVC) pattern and is responsible for handling web requests. In Grails a controller is a class with a name that ends in the convention "Controller" and lives in the `grails-app/controllers` directory. A controller can be created with the link:../ref/Command%20Line/create-controller.html[create-controller] command:

[source,java]
----
grails create-controller org.bookstore.hello
----

or with your favourite IDE or text editor.

[source,java]
----
package org.bookstore

class HelloController {

    def world() {
        render "Hello World!"
    }
}
----

Each action in the controller is a method or a Closure and it has access to a number of implicit variables and methods.

Refer to the user guide topic on <<controllers,Controllers>> for more information.
