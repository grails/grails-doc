== scope



=== Purpose


Changes the scope of a service


=== Examples


[source,java]
----
class BookService {
    static scope = "session"
    ...
}
----


=== Description


By default services are "singleton" scoped which means that clients of a service only ever use a single instance (a singleton) of the service. This behaviour can be changed by specifying a `scope` attribute with on the following values:

* `prototype` - A new service is created every time it is injected into another class
* `request` - A new service will be created per request
* `flash` - A new service will be created for the current and next request only
* `flow` - In web flows the service will exist for the scope of the flow
* `conversation` - In web flows the service will exist for the scope of the conversation. ie a root flow and its sub flows
* `session` - A service is created for the scope of a user session
* `singleton` (default) - Only one instance of the service ever exists

See <<scopedServices,Scoped Services>> in the user guide for more information.
