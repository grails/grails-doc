== transactional



=== Purpose


Enables automatic transaction demarcation if not set or set to `true`


=== Examples

----
class BookService {
    static transactional = true
    ...
}

=== Description


By default services have automatic transaction management such as propagation and so on. By setting `transactional` to `false` you disable automatic Spring managed transaction demarcation for every method in the service. When set to the `true`, The propagation level of the transaction is by default set to http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/transaction/TransactionDefinition.html#PROPAGATION_REQUIRED[PROPAGATION_REQUIRED].

You can also configure services using Spring's http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/transaction/annotation/Transactional.html[@Transactional] annotation. See <<declarativeTransactions,Declarative Transactions>> in the user guide for more information.
