== batchSize



=== Purpose


Customizes how many results are fetching during lazy loading.


=== Examples


[source,java]
----
class Book {
    ...
    static mapping = {
        batchSize 10
    }
}
----


=== Description


Usage: `batchSize(integer)`

Given a lazy association where an `Author` has many `Book`s, GORM will perform one query for the `Author` and additional queries the associated `Book`s. This is what is known as the N+1 problem and can often be worked around by using a join query. However, joins can be expensive.

Batch fetching is an optimization of lazy loading so that if, for example, you set a `batchSize` of 10 and you have an `Author` that with 30 books, instead of 31 queries you get four (one for the `Author` and three batches of 10):

[source,groovy]
----
static mapping = {
    batchSize 10
}
----

You can also configure `batchSize` on a per association basis:

[source,groovy]
----
class Author {

    static hasMany = [books: Book]

    static mapping = {
        books batchSize: 10
    }
}
----
