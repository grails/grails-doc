== lazy



=== Purpose


Configures whether to use proxies and lazy loading for one-to-one and many-to-one associations.


=== Examples


[source,groovy]
----
class Book {

    static belongsTo = [author: Author]

    static mapping = {
        author lazy: false
    }
}
----


=== Description


Usage: `association_name(lazy: boolean)`

By default GORM single-ended associations are lazy in that when you load a domain instance, an associated domain is not loaded until accessed. Hibernate creates a dynamic proxy by subclassing the domain class and proxying all methods and property access.

This can have some strange side effects (see http://www.hibernate.org/280.html[this page] on proxies at the Hibernate site) particularly in relation to inheritance. You can tell Hibernate not use proxies for single-ended associations by using the `lazy` argument:

[source,groovy]
----
static mapping = {
    author lazy: false
}
----

See the section on http://gorm.grails.org/6.0.x/hibernate/manual/index.html#fetching[Eager vs Lazing Fetching] in the user guide.
