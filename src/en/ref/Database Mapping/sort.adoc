== sort



=== Purpose


Customizes the default property to sort by for query results.


=== Examples


[source,groovy]
----
class Book {
    ...
    static mapping = {
        sort "releaseDate"
    }
}
----


=== Description


Usage: `sort(string/map)`

By default results are sorted by creation date, and you can specify the column to order by in a query:

[source,groovy]
----
def results = Book.list(sort:"title")
----

However, you can also configure the default sort property:

[source,groovy]
----
static mapping = {
    sort "title"
}
----

in which case the `sort` argument is no longer needed. You can also control the sort order:

[source,groovy]
----
static mapping = {
    sort title: "desc" // or "asc"
}
----
