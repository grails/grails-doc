h2. Description

Usage: @version(string/boolean)@

By default GORM is configured with [optimistic locking|http://gorm.grails.org/6.0.x/hibernate/manual/index.html#locking] enabled. You can disable this by calling the @version@ method with an argument of @false@:

{code}
static mapping = {
    version false
}
{code}

You can pass the name to the @version@ method to change the name of the database column:

{code}
static mapping = {
    version 'revision_number'
}
{code}
