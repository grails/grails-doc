== cascade



=== Purpose


Configures the cascading behavior of an association.


=== Examples


[source,java]
----
class Author {

    static hasMany = [books: Book]

    static mapping = {
        books cascade: 'all-delete-orphan'
    }
}
----


=== Description


Usage: `association_name(cascade:string)`

Arguments:

* `cascade` - The cascading behavior to define. Can be one or more (comma-separated) of `all`, `merge`, `save-update`, `delete`, `lock`, `refresh`, `evict`, `replicate` or `all-delete-orphan` (one-to-many associations only).

By default GORM configures a cascading policy of "all" in the case where one entity "belongs to" another. For example:

[source,groovy]
----
class Book {
    static belongsTo = [author: Author]
}
----

[source,groovy]
----
class Author {
    static hasMany = [books: Book]
}
----

Here all persistence operations will cascade from the `Author` domain to the `Book` domain. So when an `Author` is deleted so will all the associated books.

If the association doesn't define an owner (a "belongs to" relationship):

[source,groovy]
----
class Book {
}
----

[source,groovy]
----
class Author {
    static hasMany = [books: Book]
}
----

then GORM uses a cascading policy of "save-update" by default. So if an `Author` is deleted the `Book` associated domains won't be deleted. Use the `cascade` argument on an association to customize this behavior:

[source,java]
----
class Author {

    static hasMany = [books: Book]

    static mapping = {
        books cascade: 'all-delete-orphan'
    }
}
----

Using this configuration a `Book` will also be deleted if it is removed (orphaned) from an `Author`'s `books` association.
