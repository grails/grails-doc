=== plugin Usage


A plugin provides additional capability to the Grails runtime and is created with the link:../Command%20Line/create-plugin.html[create-plugin] command:

[source,java]
----
grails create-plugin simple
----

This will create a plugin project which can then be packaged with link:../Command%20Line/package-plugin.html[package-plugin]:

[source,java]
----
grails package-plugin
----

To install the plugin to your local Maven repository you can use the `install` command:

[source,java]
----
grails install
----

Refer to the user guide topic on link:{guidePath}/plugins.html[plugins] for more information.
