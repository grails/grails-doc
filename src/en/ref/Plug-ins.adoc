=== Plugin Usage

A plugin provides additional capability to the Grails runtime and is created with the link:../Command%20Line/create-plugin.html[create-plugin] command:

[source,console]
----
grails create-plugin myplugin
----

This will create a plugin project which can then be packaged as a JAR file (build/libs/myplugin-0.1.jar) using the `jar` gradle task:

[source,console]
----
./gradlew jar
----

Refer to the user guide topic on link:{guidePath}/plugins.html[plugins] for more information.
