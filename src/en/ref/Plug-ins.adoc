===== plugin Usage


A plugin provides additional capability to the Grails runtime and is created with the <<ref-command-line-create-plugin,create-plugin>> command:

[source,java]
----
grails create-plugin simple
----

This will create a plugin project which can then be packaged with <<ref-command-line-package-plugin,package-plugin>>:

[source,java]
----
grails package-plugin
----

To install the plugin to your local Maven repository you can use the `install` command:

[source,java]
----
grails install
----

Refer to the user guide topic on <<plugins,plugins>> for more information.
