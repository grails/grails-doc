=== Domain Class Usage


A domain class fulfills the M in the Model View Controller (MVC) pattern and represents a persistent entity that is mapped onto an underlying database table. In Grails a domain is a class that lives in the `grails-app/domain` directory. A domain class can be created with the link:../ref/Command%20Line/create-domain-class.html[create-domain-class] command:

[source,java]
----
grails create-domain-class org.bookstore.Book
----

or with your favourite IDE or text editor.

[source,java]
----
package org.bookstore

class Book {
    String title
    Date releaseDate
    Author author
}
----

The class name, by default, is mapped to the table name in lower case and separated by underscores instead of camel case so a domain class named `BookStore` by default would map to a table named `book_store`.  Each property maps to individual columns.

One limitation of the default table naming scheme is that it is problematic to have 2 domain classes with the same name, even if they are defined to be in separate packages.  For example, `com.bookstore.BookStore` and `com.publishing.utility.BookStore` would each map to a table named `book_store`.  If the 2 classes are defined in the application this problem can be managed by giving the classes different names or by providing a specific table name for one or both of the classes that deviates from the default (see the http://gorm.grails.org/snapshot/hibernate/6.0.x/index.html#ormdsl[ORM DSL] section of the user guide for more details).  If one or both of the domain classes is provided by a plugin the application author may not have access to those options.  To help manage a situation like that, GORM may be configured to prefix table names with plugin names by default.  For example, if the `com.publishing.utility.BookStore` domain class is provided by a plugin named `PublishingUtilities`, the default table name could be `publishing_utilities_book_store`.  To enable that behavior the `grails.gorm.table.prefix.enabled` config property must be set to true.  Example:


[source,groovy]
----
// grails-app/conf/application.groovy

grails.gorm.table.prefix.enabled = true
----

Refer to the <<conf,configuration>> section of more details on defining configuration options.
