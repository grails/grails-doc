Throughout the documentation so far the convention used for URLs has been the default of `/controller/action/id`. However, this convention is not hard wired into Grails and is in fact controlled by a URL Mappings class located at `grails-app/controllers/mypackage/UrlMappings.groovy`.

The `UrlMappings` class contains a single property called `mappings` that has been assigned a block of code:

[source,groovy]
----
package mypackage

class UrlMappings {
    static mappings = {
    }
}
