The previous section on on XML and JSON responses covered simplistic examples of rendering XML and JSON responses. Whilst the XML builder used by Grails is the standard http://groovy-lang.org/processing-xml.html#_xmlparser_and_xmlslurper[XmlSlurper] found in Groovy.

For JSON, since Grails 3.1, Grails uses Groovy's http://docs.groovy-lang.org/latest/html/documentation/core-domain-specific-languages.html#_streamingjsonbuilder[StreamingJsonBuilder] by default and you can refer to the http://docs.groovy-lang.org/latest/html/documentation/core-domain-specific-languages.html#_streamingjsonbuilder[Groovy documentation] and http://docs.groovy-lang.org/latest/html/gapi/groovy/json/StreamingJsonBuilder.html[StreamingJsonBuilder] API documentation on how to use it.

In older version of Grails a custom JSON builder was used called http://docs.grails.org/latest/api/grails/web/JSONBuilder.html[grails.web.JSONBuilder]. This class is considered deprecated. However, if you are upgrading an application you can re-enable it with the following configuration in `application.groovy`:

[source,groovy]
----
grails.json.legacy.builder = false
