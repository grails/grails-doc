==== Programmatic File Uploads


Grails supports file uploads using Spring's http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/multipart/MultipartHttpServletRequest.html[MultipartHttpServletRequest] interface. The first step for file uploading is to create a multipart form like this:

[source,xml]
----
Upload Form: <br />
    <g:uploadForm action="upload">
        <input type="file" name="myFile" />
        <input type="submit" />
    </g:uploadForm>
----

The `uploadForm` tag conveniently adds the `enctype="multipart/form-data"` attribute to the standard `<g:form>` tag.

There are then a number of ways to handle the file upload. One is to work with the Spring http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/multipart/MultipartFile.html[MultipartFile] instance directly:

[source,java]
----
def upload() {
    def f = request.getFile('myFile')
    if (f.empty) {
        flash.message = 'file cannot be empty'
        render(view: 'uploadForm')
        return
    }

    f.transferTo(new File('/some/local/dir/myfile.txt'))
    response.sendError(200, 'Done')
}
----

This is convenient for doing transfers to other destinations and manipulating the file directly as you can obtain an `InputStream` and so on with the http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/multipart/MultipartFile.html[MultipartFile] interface.


==== File Uploads through Data Binding


File uploads can also be performed using data binding. Consider this `Image` domain class:

[source,java]
----
class Image {
    byte[] myFile

    static constraints = {
        // Limit upload file size to 2MB
        myFile maxSize: 1024 * 1024 * 2
    }
}
----

If you create an image using the `params` object in the constructor as in the example below, Grails will automatically bind the file's contents as a `byte[]` to the `myFile` property:

[source,java]
----
def img = new Image(params)
----

It's important that you set the link:../ref/Constraints/size.html[size] or link:../ref/Constraints/maxSize.html[maxSize] constraints, otherwise your database may be created with a small column size that can't handle reasonably sized files. For example, both H2 and MySQL default to a blob size of 255 bytes for `byte[]` properties.

It is also possible to set the contents of the file as a string by changing the type of the `myFile` property on the image to a String type:

[source,java]
----
class Image {
   String myFile
}
----
