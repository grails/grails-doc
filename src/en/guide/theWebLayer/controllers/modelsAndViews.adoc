==== Returning the Model


A model is a Map that the view uses when rendering. The keys within that Map correspond to variable names accessible by the view. There are a couple of ways to return a model. First, you can explicitly return a Map instance:

[source,java]
----
def show() {
    [book: Book.get(params.id)]
}
----

NOTE: The above does _not_ reflect what you should use with the scaffolding views - see the link:scaffolding.html[scaffolding section] for more details.

A more advanced approach is to return an instance of the Spring http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/ModelAndView.html[ModelAndView] class:

[source,java]
----
import org.springframework.web.servlet.ModelAndView

def index() {
    // get some books just for the index page, perhaps your favorites
    def favoriteBooks = ...

    // forward to the list view to show them
    return new ModelAndView("/book/list", [ bookList : favoriteBooks ])
}
----

One thing to bear in mind is that certain variable names can not be used in your model:

* `attributes`
* `application`

Currently, no error will be reported if you do use them, but this will hopefully change in a future version of Grails.


==== Selecting the View


In both of the previous two examples there was no code that specified which <<gsp,view>> to render. So how does Grails know which one to pick? The answer lies in the conventions. Grails will look for a view at the location `grails-app/views/book/show.gsp` for this `show` action:

[source,java]
----
class BookController {
    def show() {
         [book: Book.get(params.id)]
    }
}
----

To render a different view, use the link:../ref/Controllers/render.html[render] method:

[source,java]
----
def show() {
    def map = [book: Book.get(params.id)]
    render(view: "display", model: map)
}
----

In this case Grails will attempt to render a view at the location `grails-app/views/book/display.gsp`. Notice that Grails automatically qualifies the view location with the `book` directory of the `grails-app/views` directory. This is convenient, but to access shared views you need instead you can use an absolute path instead of a relative one:

[source,java]
----
def show() {
    def map = [book: Book.get(params.id)]
    render(view: "/shared/display", model: map)
}
----

In this case Grails will attempt to render a view at the location `grails-app/views/shared/display.gsp`.

Grails also supports JSPs as views, so if a GSP isn't found in the expected location but a JSP is, it will be used instead.

==== Selecting Views For Namespaced Controllers


If a controller defines a namespace for itself with the <<namespacedControllers,namespace>> property that will affect the root directory in which Grails will look for views which are specified with a relative path.  The default root directory for views rendered by a namespaced controller is `grails-app/views/<namespace name>/<controller name>/`.  If the view is not found in the namespaced directory then Grails will fallback to looking for the view in the non-namespaced directory.

See the example below.

[source,java]
----
class ReportingController {
    static namespace = 'business'

    def humanResources() {
        // This will render grails-app/views/business/reporting/humanResources.gsp
        // if it exists.

        // If grails-app/views/business/reporting/humanResources.gsp does not
        // exist the fallback will be grails-app/views/reporting/humanResources.gsp.

        // The namespaced GSP will take precedence over the non-namespaced GSP.

        [numberOfEmployees: 9]
    }


    def accountsReceivable() {
        // This will render grails-app/views/business/reporting/accounting.gsp
        // if it exists.

        // If grails-app/views/business/reporting/accounting.gsp does not
        // exist the fallback will be grails-app/views/reporting/accounting.gsp.

        // The namespaced GSP will take precedence over the non-namespaced GSP.

        render view: 'numberCrunch', model: [numberOfEmployees: 13]
    }
}
----


==== Rendering a Response


Sometimes it's easier (for example with Ajax applications) to render snippets of text or code to the response directly from the controller. For this, the highly flexible `render` method can be used:

[source,java]
----
render "Hello World!"
----

The above code writes the text "Hello World!" to the response. Other examples include:

[source,groovy]
----
// write some markup
render {
   for (b in books) {
      div(id: b.id, b.title)
   }
}
----

[source,groovy]
----
// render a specific view
render(view: 'show')
----

[source,groovy]
----
// render a template for each item in a collection
render(template: 'book_template', collection: Book.list())
----

[source,groovy]
----
// render some text with encoding and content type
render(text: "<xml>some xml</xml>", contentType: "text/xml", encoding: "UTF-8")
----

If you plan on using Groovy's `MarkupBuilder` to generate HTML for use with the `render` method be careful of naming clashes between HTML elements and Grails tags, for example:

[source,java]
----
import groovy.xml.MarkupBuilder
...
def login() {
    def writer = new StringWriter()
    def builder = new MarkupBuilder(writer)
    builder.html {
        head {
            title 'Log in'
        }
        body {
            h1 'Hello'
            form {
            }
        }
    }

    def html = writer.toString()
    render html
}
----

This will actually <<tagsAsMethodCalls,call the form tag>> (which will return some text that will be ignored by the `MarkupBuilder`). To correctly output a `<form>` element, use the following:

[source,java]
----
def login() {
    // ...
    body {
        h1 'Hello'
        builder.form {
        }
    }
    // ...
}
----
