Grails controllers support the concept of command objects. A command object is a class that is used in conjunction with [data binding|guide:dataBinding] to allow validation of data that may not fit into an existing domain class.

h4. Declaring Command Objects

Command object classes are defined just like any other class.

{code:java}
@grails.validation.Validateable
class LoginCommand {
    String username
    String password

    static constraints = {
        username(blank: false, minSize: 6)
        password(blank: false, minSize: 6)
    }
}
{code}

In this example, the command object is marked with the @Validateable@ annotation. The @Validateable@ annotation allows the definition of [constraints|guide:constraints] just like in [domain classes|guide:GORM]. If the command object is defined in the same source file as the controller that is using it, Grails will automatically mark it as @Validateable@. It is not required that command object classes be validateable.

h4. Using Command Objects

To use command objects, controller actions may optionally specify any number of command object parameters. The parameter types must be supplied so that Grails knows what objects to create and initialize.

Before the controller action is executed Grails will automatically create an instance of the command object class and populate its properties by binding the request parameters.  If the command object class is marked with @Validateable@ then the command object will be validated. For example:

{code:java}
class LoginController {

    def login(LoginCommand cmd) {
        if (cmd.hasErrors()) {
            redirect(action: 'loginForm')
            return
        }

        // work with the command object data
    }
}
{code}

h4. Command Objects and Dependency Injection

Command objects can participate in dependency injection. This is useful if your command object has some custom validation logic which uses a Grails [service|guide:services]:

{code}
@grails.validation.Validateable
class LoginCommand {

    def loginService

    String username
    String password

    static constraints = {
        username validator: { val, obj ->
            obj.loginService.canLogin(obj.username, obj.password)
        }
    }
}
{code}

In this example the command object interacts with the @loginService@ bean which is injected by name from the Spring @ApplicationContext@.
