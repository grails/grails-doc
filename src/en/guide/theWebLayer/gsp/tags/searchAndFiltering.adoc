If you have collections of objects you often need to sort and filter them. Use the link:../ref/Tags/findAll.html[findAll] and link:../ref/Tags/grep.html[grep] tags for these tasks:

[source,xml]
----
Stephen King's Books:
<g:findAll in="${books}" expr="it.author == 'Stephen King'">
     <p>Title: ${it.title}</p>
</g:findAll>
----

The `expr` attribute contains a Groovy expression that can be used as a filter. The link:../ref/Tags/grep.html[grep] tag does a similar job, for example filtering by class:

[source,xml]
----
<g:grep in="${books}" filter="NonFictionBooks.class">
     <p>Title: ${it.title}</p>
</g:grep>
----

Or using a regular expression:

[source,xml]
----
<g:grep in="${books.title}" filter="~/.*?Groovy.*?/">
     <p>Title: ${it}</p>
</g:grep>
----

The above example is also interesting due to its usage of GPath. GPath is an XPath-like language in Groovy. The `books` variable is a collection of `Book` instances. Since each `Book` has a `title`, you can obtain a list of Book titles using the expression `books.title`. Groovy will auto-magically iterate the collection, obtain each title, and return a new list!
