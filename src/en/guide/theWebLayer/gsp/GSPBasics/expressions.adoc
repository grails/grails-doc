In GSP the `<%= %>` syntax introduced earlier is rarely used due to the support for GSP expressions. A GSP expression is similar to a JSP EL expression or a Groovy GString and takes the form `${expr}`:

[source,xml]
----
<html>
  <body>
    Hello ${params.name}
  </body>
</html>
----

However, unlike JSP EL you can have any Groovy expression within the `${..}` block.
