==== Creating Layouts


Grails leverages http://sitemesh.org[Sitemesh], a decorator engine, to support view layouts. Layouts are located in the `grails-app/views/layouts` directory. A typical layout can be seen below:

[source,xml]
----
<html>
    <head>
        <title><g:layoutTitle default="An example decorator" /></title>
        <g:layoutHead />
    </head>
    <body onload="${pageProperty(name:'body.onload')}">
        <div class="menu"><!--my common menu goes here--></div>
        <div class="body">
            <g:layoutBody />
        </div>
    </body>
</html>
----

The key elements are the link:../ref/Tags/layoutHead.html[layoutHead], link:../ref/Tags/layoutTitle.html[layoutTitle] and link:../ref/Tags/layoutBody.html[layoutBody] tag invocations:

* `layoutTitle` - outputs the target page's title
* `layoutHead` - outputs the target page's head tag contents
* `layoutBody` - outputs the target page's body tag contents

The previous example also demonstrates the link:../ref/Tags/pageProperty.html[pageProperty] tag which can be used to inspect and return aspects of the target page.


==== Triggering Layouts


There are a few ways to trigger a layout. The simplest is to add a meta tag to the view:

[source,xml]
----
<html>
    <head>
        <title>An Example Page</title>
        <meta name="layout" content="main" />
    </head>
    <body>This is my content!</body>
</html>
----

In this case a layout called `grails-app/views/layouts/main.gsp` will be used to layout the page. If we were to use the layout from the previous section the output would resemble this:

[source,xml]
----
<html>
    <head>
        <title>An Example Page</title>
    </head>
    <body onload="">
        <div class="menu"><!--my common menu goes here--></div>
        <div class="body">
            This is my content!
        </div>
    </body>
</html>
----


==== Specifying A Layout In A Controller


Another way to specify a layout is to specify the name of the layout by assigning a value to the "layout" property in a controller. For example, if you have a controller such as:

[source,java]
----
class BookController {
    static layout = 'customer'

    def list() { ... }
}
----

You can create a layout called `grails-app/views/layouts/customer.gsp` which will be applied to all views that the `BookController` delegates to.  The value of the "layout" property may contain a directory structure relative to the `grails-app/views/layouts/` directory.  For example:

[source,java]
----
class BookController {
    static layout = 'custom/customer'

    def list() { ... }
}
----

Views rendered from that controller would be decorated with the `grails-app/views/layouts/custom/customer.gsp` template.


==== Layout by Convention


Another way to associate layouts is to use "layout by convention". For example, if you have this controller:

[source,java]
----
class BookController {
    def list() { ... }
}
----

You can create a layout called `grails-app/views/layouts/book.gsp`, which will be applied to all views that the `BookController` delegates to.

Alternatively, you can create a layout called `grails-app/views/layouts/book/list.gsp` which will only be applied to the `list` action within the `BookController`.

If you have both the above mentioned layouts in place the layout specific to the action will take precedence when the list action is executed.

If a layout may not be located using any of those conventions, the convention of last resort is to look for the application default layout which
is `grails-app/views/layouts/application.gsp`.  The name of the application default layout may be changed by defining a property
in `grails-app/conf/application.groovy` as follows:

[source,java]
----
grails.sitemesh.default.layout = 'myLayoutName'
----

With that property in place, the application default layout will be `grails-app/views/layouts/myLayoutName.gsp`.


==== Inline Layouts


Grails' also supports Sitemesh's concept of inline layouts with the link:../ref/Tags/applyLayout.html[applyLayout] tag. This can be used to apply a layout to a template, URL or arbitrary section of content. This lets you even further modularize your view structure by "decorating" your template includes.

Some examples of usage can be seen below:

[source,xml]
----
<g:applyLayout name="myLayout" template="bookTemplate" collection="${books}" />

<g:applyLayout name="myLayout" url="http://www.google.com" />

<g:applyLayout name="myLayout">
The content to apply a layout to
</g:applyLayout>
----


==== Server-Side Includes


While the link:../ref/Tags/applyLayout.html[applyLayout] tag is useful for applying layouts to external content, if you simply want to include external content in the current page you use the link:../ref/Tags/include.html[include] tag:

[source,xml]
----
<g:include controller="book" action="list" />
----

You can even combine the link:../ref/Tags/include.html[include] tag and the link:../ref/Tags/applyLayout.html[applyLayout] tag for added flexibility:

[source,xml]
----
<g:applyLayout name="myLayout">
   <g:include controller="book" action="list" />
</g:applyLayout>
----

Finally, you can also call the link:../ref/Tags/include.html[include] tag from a controller or tag library as a method:

[source,java]
----
def content = include(controller:"book", action:"list")
----

The resulting content will be provided via the return value of the link:../ref/Tags/include.html[include] tag.
