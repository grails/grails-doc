Grails also has the concept of templates. These are useful for partitioning your views into maintainable chunks, and combined with <<layouts,Layouts>> provide a highly re-usable mechanism for structured views.


==== Template Basics


Grails uses the convention of placing an underscore before the name of a view to identify it as a template. For example, you might have a template that renders Books located at `grails-app/views/book/_bookTemplate.gsp`:

[source,xml]
----
<div class="book" id="${book?.id}">
   <div>Title: ${book?.title}</div>
   <div>Author: ${book?.author?.name}</div>
</div>
----

Use the link:../ref/Tags/render.html[render] tag to render this template from one of the views in `grails-app/views/book`:

[source,xml]
----
<g:render template="bookTemplate" model="[book: myBook]" />
----

Notice how we pass into a model to use using the `model` attribute of the `render` tag. If you have multiple `Book` instances you can also render the template for each `Book` using the render tag with a `collection` attribute:

[source,xml]
----
<g:render template="bookTemplate" var="book" collection="${bookList}" />
----


==== Shared Templates


In the previous example we had a template that was specific to the `BookController` and its views at `grails-app/views/book`. However, you may want to share templates across your application.

In this case you can place them in the root views directory at grails-app/views or any subdirectory below that location, and then with the template attribute use an absolute location starting with `/` instead of a relative location. For example if you had a template called `grails-app/views/shared/_mySharedTemplate.gsp`, you would reference it as:

[source,xml]
----
<g:render template="/shared/mySharedTemplate" />
----

You can also use this technique to reference templates in any directory from any view or controller:

[source,xml]
----
<g:render template="/book/bookTemplate" model="[book: myBook]" />
----


==== The Template Namespace


Since templates are used so frequently there is template namespace, called `tmpl`, available that makes using templates easier. Consider for example the following usage pattern:

[source,xml]
----
<g:render template="bookTemplate" model="[book:myBook]" />
----

This can be expressed with the `tmpl` namespace as follows:

[source,xml]
----
<tmpl:bookTemplate book="${myBook}" />
----


==== Templates in Controllers and Tag Libraries


You can also render templates from controllers using the link:../ref/Controllers/render.html[render] controller method. This is useful for JavaScript heavy applications where you generate small HTML or data responses to partially update the current page instead of performing new request:

[source,java]
----
def bookData() {
    def b = Book.get(params.id)
    render(template:"bookTemplate", model:[book:b])
}
----

The link:../ref/Controllers/render.html[render] controller method writes directly to the response, which is the most common behaviour. To instead obtain the result of template as a String you can use the link:../ref/Tags/render.html[render] tag:

[source,java]
----
def bookData() {
    def b = Book.get(params.id)
    String content = g.render(template:"bookTemplate", model:[book:b])
    render content
}
----

Notice the usage of the `g` namespace which tells Grails we want to use the <<tagsAsMethodCalls,tag as method call>> instead of the link:../ref/Controllers/render.html[render] method.
