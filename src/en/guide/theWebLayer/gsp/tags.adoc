Now that the less attractive JSP heritage has been set aside, the following sections cover GSP's built-in tags, which are the preferred way to define GSP pages.

NOTE: The section on <<taglibs,Tag Libraries>> covers how to add your own custom tag libraries.

All built-in GSP tags start with the prefix `g:`. Unlike JSP, you don't specify any tag library imports. If a tag starts with `g:` it is automatically assumed to be a GSP tag. An example GSP tag would look like:

[source,xml]
----
<g:example />
----

GSP tags can also have a body such as:

[source,xml]
----
<g:example>
   Hello world
</g:example>
----

Expressions can be passed into GSP tag attributes, if an expression is not used it will be assumed to be a String value:

[source,xml]
----
<g:example attr="${new Date()}">
   Hello world
</g:example>
----

Maps can also be passed into GSP tag attributes, which are often used for a named parameter style syntax:

[source,xml]
----
<g:example attr="${new Date()}" attr2="[one:1, two:2, three:3]">
   Hello world
</g:example>
----

Note that within the values of attributes you must use single quotes for Strings:

[source,xml]
----
<g:example attr="${new Date()}" attr2="[one:'one', two:'two']">
   Hello world
</g:example>
----

With the basic syntax out the way, the next sections look at the tags that are built into Grails by default.
