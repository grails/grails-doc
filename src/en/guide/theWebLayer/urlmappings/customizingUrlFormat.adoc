The default URL Mapping mechanism supports camel case names in the URLs.  The default URL for accessing an action named `addNumbers` in a controller named `MathHelperController` would be something like `/mathHelper/addNumbers`.  Grails allows for the customization of this pattern and provides an implementation which replaces the camel case convention with a hyphenated convention that would support URLs like `/math-helper/add-numbers`.  To enable hyphenated URLs assign a value of "hyphenated" to the `grails.web.url.converter` property in `grails-app/conf/application.groovy`.

[source,java]
----
// grails-app/conf/application.groovy

grails.web.url.converter = 'hyphenated'
----

Arbitrary strategies may be plugged in by providing a class which implements the http://docs.grails.org/latest/api/grails/web/UrlConverter.html[UrlConverter] interface and adding an instance of that class to the Spring application context with the bean name of `grails.web.UrlConverter.BEAN_NAME`.  If Grails finds a bean in the context with that name, it will be used as the default converter and there is no need to assign a value to the `grails.web.url.converter` config property.

[source,java]
----
// src/groovy/com/myapplication/MyUrlConverterImpl.groovy

package com.myapplication

class MyUrlConverterImpl implements grails.web.UrlConverter {

    String toUrlElement(String propertyOrClassName) {
        // return some representation of a property or class name that should be used in URLs...
    }
}
----

[source,java]
----
// grails-app/conf/spring/resources.groovy

beans = {
    "${grails.web.UrlConverter.BEAN_NAME}"(com.myapplication.MyUrlConverterImpl)
}
