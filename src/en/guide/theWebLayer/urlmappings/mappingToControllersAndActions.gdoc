To create a simple mapping simply use a relative URL as the method name and specify named parameters for the controller and action to map to:

{code:java}
"/product"(controller: "product", action: "list")
{code}

In this case we've mapped the URL @/product@ to the @list@ action of the @ProductController@. Omit the action definition to map to the default action of the controller:

{code:java}
"/product"(controller: "product")
{code}

An alternative syntax is to assign the controller and action to use within a block passed to the method:

{code:java}
"/product" {
    controller = "product"
    action = "list"
}
{code}

Which syntax you use is largely dependent on personal preference. 

If you have mappings that all fall under a particular path you can group mappings with the @group@ method:

{code:java}
group "/product", {
    "/apple"(controller:"product", id:"apple")
    "/htc"(controller:"product", id:"htc")
}
{code}

You can also create nested @group@ url mappings:

{code:java}
group "/store", {
    group "/product", {
        "/$id"(controller:"product")
    }
}
{code}


To rewrite one URI onto another explicit URI (rather than a controller/action pair) do something like this:

{code}
"/hello"(uri: "/hello.dispatch")
{code}

Rewriting specific URIs is often useful when integrating with other frameworks.
