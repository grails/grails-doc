Grails' URL mappings mechanism also supports wildcard mappings. For example consider the following mapping:

[source,groovy]
----
static mappings = {
    "/images/*.jpg"(controller: "image")
}
----

This mapping will match all paths to images such as `/image/logo.jpg`. Of course you can achieve the same effect with a variable:

[source,groovy]
----
static mappings = {
    "/images/$name.jpg"(controller: "image")
}
----

However, you can also use double wildcards to match more than one level below:

[source,groovy]
----
static mappings = {
    "/images/**.jpg"(controller: "image")
}
----

In this cases the mapping will match `/image/logo.jpg` as well as `/image/other/logo.jpg`. Even better you can use a double wildcard variable:

[source,groovy]
----
static mappings = {
    // will match /images/logo.jpg and /images/other/logo.jpg
    "/images/$name**.jpg"(controller: "image")
}
----

In this case it will store the path matched by the wildcard inside a `name` parameter obtainable from the link:../ref/Controllers/params.html[params] object:

[source,groovy]
----
def name = params.name
println name // prints "logo" or "other/logo"
----

If you use wildcard URL mappings then you may want to exclude certain URIs from Grails' URL mapping process. To do this you can provide an `excludes` setting inside the `UrlMappings.groovy` class:

[source,groovy]
----
class UrlMappings {
    static excludes = ["/images/*", "/css/*"]
    static mappings = {
        ...
    }
}
----

In this case Grails won't attempt to match any URIs that start with `/images` or `/css`.
