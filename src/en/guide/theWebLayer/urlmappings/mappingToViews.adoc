You can resolve a URL to a view without a controller or action involved. For example to map the root URL `/` to a GSP at the location `grails-app/views/index.gsp` you could use:

[source,groovy]
----
static mappings = {
    "/"(view: "/index")  // map the root URL
}
----

Alternatively if you need a view that is specific to a given controller you could use:

[source,groovy]
----
static mappings = {
   "/help"(controller: "site", view: "help") // to a view for a controller
}
----
