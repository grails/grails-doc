The @create-*@ commands in Grails automatically create unit or integration tests for you within the @src/test/groovy@ directory. It is of course up to you to populate these tests with valid test logic, information on which can be found in the section on [Testing|guide:testing].

To execute tests you run the [test-app|commandLine] command as follows:

{code}
grails test-app
{code}
