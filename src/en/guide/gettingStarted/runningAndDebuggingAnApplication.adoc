Grails applications can be run with the built in Tomcat server using the link:../ref/Command%20Line/run-app.html[run-app] command which will load a server on port 8080 by default:

[source,bash]
----
grails run-app
----

You can specify a different port by using the `server.port` argument:

[source,bash]
----
grails run-app -port=8090 
----

Note that it is better to start up the application in interactive mode since a container restart is much quicker:

[source,bash]
----
$ grails
grails> run-app
| Server running. Browse to http://localhost:8080/helloworld
| Application loaded in interactive mode. Type 'stop-app' to shutdown.
| Downloading: plugins-list.xml
grails> stop-app
| Stopping Grails server
grails> run-app
| Server running. Browse to http://localhost:8080/helloworld
| Application loaded in interactive mode. Type 'stop-app' to shutdown.
| Downloading: plugins-list.xml
----

You can debug a grails app by simply right-clicking on the `Application.groovy` class in your IDE and choosing the appropriate action (since Grails 3).

Alternatively, you can run your app with the following command and then attach a remote debugger to it.

[source,bash]
----
grails run-app --debug-jvm
----

More information on the link:../ref/Command%20Line/run-app.html[run-app] command can be found in the reference guide.
