Grails applications can be run with the built in Tomcat server using the link:../ref/Command%20Line/run-app.html[bootRun] command which will load a server on port 8080 by default:

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew bootRun
----

You can specify a different port by using the `-port` argument:

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew bootRun "-Pargs=port=8081"
----

You can debug a grails app by simply right-clicking on the `Application.groovy` class in your IDE and choosing the appropriate action (since Grails 3).

Alternatively, you can run your app with the following command and then attach a remote debugger to it.

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew bootRun --debug-jvm
----

More information on the link:../ref/Command%20Line/run-app.html[bootRun] command can be found in the reference guide.
