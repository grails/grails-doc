To create a Grails application you first need to familiarize yourself with the usage of the `grails` command which is used in the following manner:

[source,groovy]
----
grails <<command name>>
----

Run <<ref-command-line-create-app,create-app>> to create an application:

----
grails create-app helloworld
----

This will create a new directory inside the current one that contains the project. Navigate to this directory in your console:

[source,groovy]
----
cd helloworld
----
