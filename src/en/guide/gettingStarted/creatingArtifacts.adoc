Grails ships with a few convenience targets such as link:../ref/Command%20Line/create-controller.html[create-controller], link:../ref/Command%20Line/create-domain-class.html[create-domain-class] and so on that will create link:theWebLayer.html#controllers[controllers] and different artefact types for you.
NOTE: These are just for your convenience and you can just as easily use an IDE or your favourite text editor.
For example to create the basis of an application you typically need a link:GORM.html[domain model]:

[source,bash]
----
grails create-app helloworld
cd helloworld
grails create-domain-class book
----

This will result in the creation of a domain class at `grails-app/domain/helloworld/Book.groovy` such as:

[source,groovy]
----
package helloworld

class Book {
}
----

There are many such `create-*` commands that can be explored in the command line reference guide.

NOTE: To decrease the amount of time it takes to run Grails scripts, use the interactive mode.
