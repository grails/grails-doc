The `create-*` commands in Grails automatically create unit or integration tests for you within the `src/test/groovy` directory. It is of course up to you to populate these tests with valid test logic, information on which can be found in the section on link:testing.html[Unit and integration tests].

To execute tests you run the link:../ref/Command%20Line/test-app.html[test-app] command as follows:

[source,groovy]

grails test-app
