Grails ships with a few convenience targets such as [create-controller|commandLine], [create-domain-class|commandLine] and so on that will create [Controllers|guide:controllers] and different artefact types for you.
{note}
These are just for your convenience and you can just as easily use an IDE or your favourite text editor.
{note}
For example to create the basis of an application you typically need a [domain model|guide:GORM]:

{code}
grails create-app helloworld
cd helloworld
grails create-domain-class book
{code}

This will result in the creation of a domain class at @grails-app/domain/helloworld/Book.groovy@ such as:

{code}
package helloworld

class Book {
}
{code}

There are many such @create-*@ commands that can be explored in the command line reference guide.

To decrease the amount of time it takes to run Grails scripts, use the interactive mode.
