= Downloading and installing

The first step to getting up and running with Grails is to install the distribution.

The best way to install Grails on *nix systems is with http://sdkman.io[SDKMAN] which greatly simplifies installing and managing multiple Grails versions.

== Install with SDKMAN

To install the latest version of Grails using SDKMAN, run this on your terminal:

[source,shell]
sdk install grails

You can also specify a version

[source,shell]
sdk install grails 3.2.3

You can find more information about SDKMAN usage on the http://sdkman.io/usage.html[SDKMAN Docs]

== Manual installation

For manual installation follow these steps:

* https://github.com/grails/grails-core/releases[Download] a binary distribution of Grails and extract the resulting zip file to a location of your choice
* Set the GRAILS_HOME environment variable to the location where you extracted the zip
** On Unix/Linux based systems this is typically a matter of adding something like the following `export GRAILS_HOME=/path/to/grails` to your profile
** On Windows this is typically a matter of setting an environment variable under `My Computer/Advanced/Environment Variables`
* Then add the `bin` directory to your `PATH` variable:
** On Unix/Linux based systems this can be done by adding `export PATH="$PATH:$GRAILS_HOME/bin"` to your profile
** On Windows this is done by modifying the `Path` environment variable under `My Computer/Advanced/Environment Variables`

If Grails is working correctly you should now be able to type `grails -version` in the terminal window and see output similar to this:

[source,groovy,subs="attributes"]
----
Grails version: {version}
----
