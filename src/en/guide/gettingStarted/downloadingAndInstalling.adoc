The first step to getting up and running with Grails is to install the distribution.

The best way to install Grails on *nix systems is with https://sdkman.io[SDKMAN] which greatly simplifies installing and managing multiple Grails versions.

=== Install with SDKMAN

To install the latest version of Grails using SDKMAN, run this on your terminal:

[source,console]
$ sdk install grails

You can also specify a version

[source,console,subs=attributes+]
$ sdk install grails {version}

You can find more information about SDKMAN usage on the https://sdkman.io/usage[SDKMAN Docs]

=== Manual installation

For manual installation follow these steps:

* https://github.com/grails/grails-core/releases[Download] a binary distribution of Grails and extract the resulting zip file to a location of your choice
* Set the GRAILS_HOME environment variable to the location where you extracted the zip

=== Unix/Linux
** This is typically a matter of adding something like the following `export GRAILS_HOME=/path/to/grails` to your profile
** This can be done by adding `export PATH="$PATH:$GRAILS_HOME/bin"` to your profile

=== Windows
** Copy the path to the bin directory inside the grails folder you have downloaded, for example,

----
C:\path_to_grails\bin
----

** Go to Environment Variables, you can typically search or run the command below, the type env and then Enter

----
Start + R
----

** Edit the Path variable on User Variables / System Variables depending on your choice.
** Paste the copied path in the Path Variable.

If Grails is working correctly you should now be able to type `grails --version` in the terminal window and see output similar to this:

[source,console,subs=attributes+]
----
Grails Version: {version}
----
