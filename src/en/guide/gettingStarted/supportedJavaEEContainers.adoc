Grails runs on any container that supports Servlet 3.0 and above and is known to work on the following specific container products:

* Tomcat 7 (end of life) 
* GlassFish 3 or above
* Resin 4 or above
* JBoss 6 or above
* Jetty 8 or above
* Oracle Weblogic 12c or above
* IBM WebSphere 8.0 or above

NOTE: It's required to set "-Xverify:none" in "Application servers > server > Process Definition > Java Virtual Machine > Generic JVM arguments" for older versions of WebSphere. This is no longer needed for WebSphere version 8 or newer.

Some containers have bugs however, which in most cases can be worked around. A https://grails.org/wiki/version/Deployment/92[list of known deployment issues] can be found on the Grails wiki.

In addition, reference the http://guides.grails.org/[Grails Guides] for tips on how to deploy Grails to various popular Cloud services.
