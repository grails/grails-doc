Since 3.0, Grails has an interactive mode which makes command execution faster since the JVM doesn't have to be restarted for each command. To use interactive mode simply type 'grails' from the root of any projects and use TAB completion to get a list of available commands. See the screenshot below for an example:

For more information on the capabilities of interactive mode refer to the section on link:commandLine.html#interactiveMode[Interactive Mode] in the user guide.
