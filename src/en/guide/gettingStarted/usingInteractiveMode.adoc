The Grails Command-line Interface (CLI) offers an interactive mode, which you can access by entering "grails" in your Terminal application or Linux Command Line.

Once you're in the command-line interface, you can enhance your efficiency by utilizing the TAB key for auto-completion. For instance:

[source,console]
----
grails> create
create-app            create-plugin         create-webapp
create-controller     create-restapi
create-domain-class   create-web-plugin
----

This interactive mode provides a convenient way to explore available Grails commands and options, making your Grails development workflow more efficient and user-friendly.
