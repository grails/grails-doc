h4. IntelliJ IDEA

[IntelliJ IDEA|http://www.jetbrains.com/idea] is an excellent IDE for Grails 3.0 development. It comes in 2 editions, the free community edition and the paid-for ultimate edition.

The community edition can be used for most things, although GSP syntax higlighting is only part of the ultimate edition. To get started with Intellij IDEA and Grails 3.0 simply go to @File / Import Project@ and point IDEA at your @build.gradle@ file to import and configure the project.

h4. Eclipse

We recommend that users of "Eclipse":http://www.eclipse.org/ looking to develop Grails application take a look at [Groovy/Grails Tool Suite|https://spring.io/tools/ggts], which offers built in support for Grails including automatic classpath management, a GSP editor and quick access to Grails commands.

Like Intellij you can import a Grails 3.0 project using the Gradle project integration.

h4. NetBeans

NetBeans provides a Groovy/Grails plugin that automatically recognizes Grails projects and provides the ability to run Grails applications in the IDE, code completion and integration with the Glassfish server. For an overview of features see the [NetBeans Integration|http://www.grails.org/NetBeans+Integration] guide on the Grails website which was written by the NetBeans team.

h4. TextMate, Sublime, VIM etc.

There are several excellent text editors that work nicely with Groovy and Grails. See below for references:
