=== Quick Start with Grails Scaffolding

To quickly initiate your Grails project, you can employ the `runCommand` Gradle task. This task allows you to generate the essential structure of an application swiftly. Specifically, when running the following command, you can create a link:theWebLayer.html#controllers[controller] (including its unit tests) and the associated link:theWebLayer.html#gsp[views] for your application:

[source,console]
----
$ ./gradlew runCommand -Pargs="generate-all myapp.Book"
----
