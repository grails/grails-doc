=== Overview


Grails provides a number of traits which provide access to properties and behavior that may be accessed from various Grails artefacts as well as arbitrary Groovy classes which are part of a Grails project.  Many of these traits are automatically added to Grails artefact classes (like controllers and taglibs, for example) and are easy to add to other classes.
