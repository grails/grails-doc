=== "grails run-app"


You should be very familiar with this approach by now, since it is the most common method of running an application during the development phase. An embedded Tomcat server is launched that loads the web application from the development sources, thus allowing it to pick up any changes to application files.

You can also deploy to production this way using:

[source,groovy]
----
grails prod run-app
----


=== Runnable WAR or JAR file


Another way to deploy in Grails 3.0 or above is to use the new support for runnable JAR or WAR files. To create runnable archives, run `grails package`:

[source,xml]
----
grails package
----

You can then run either the WAR file or the JAR using your Java installation:

[source,groovy]
----
java -Dgrails.env=prod -jar build/libs/mywar-0.1.war    (or .jar)
----

=== A TAR/ZIP distribution

WARNING: Note: TAR/ZIP distribution assembly has been removed from Grails 3.1.
