=== Setting up HTTPS and SSL certificates for standalone deployment


To configure an SSL certificate and to listen on an HTTPS port instead of HTTP, add properties like these to `application.yml`:

[source,groovy]
----
server:
    port: 8443                                             # The port to listen on
    ssl:
        enabled: true                                      # Activate HTTPS mode on the server port
        key-store: <the-location-of-your-keystore>         # e.g. /etc/tomcat7/keystore/tomcat.keystore
        key-store-password: <your-key-store-password>      # e.g. changeit
        key-alias: <your-key-alias>                        # e.g. tomcat
        key-password: <usually-the-same-as-your-key-store-password>
----

These settings control the embedded Tomcat container for a production deployment. Alternatively, the properties can be specified on the command-line. Example: `-Dserver.ssl.enabled=true -Dserver.ssl.key-store=/path/to/keystore`.

NOTE: Configuration of both an HTTP and HTTPS connector via application properties is not supported. If you want to have both, then you'll need to configure one of them programmatically. (More information on how to do this can be found in the how-to guide below.)

There are other relevant settings. Further reference:
