If you are upgrading from Grails 3.1 there are a few items to take into consideration.


==== Deprecated Classes and Methods Removed


Classes and methods deprecated in Grails 3.0.x have been removed in Grails 3.2. This includes all classes in the `org.codehaus.groovy.grails` package. If your application or plugin uses deprecated classes they should be updated to use non-deprecated replacements.


==== Slf4j Now Default


The `log` property injected at compile time into all classes is now an Slf4j `Logger` instance and not an instance of the Commons Logging `Log` class.

This should be a simple upgrade for most use cases, however this change does have some implications, for example it is no longer possible to pass non-string types to the log method. Example:

[source,groovy]
----
log.info "this works"
Double notAString = 9.2
log.info notAString
----

The latter call to the `info` method will throw an exception as it is not a String.

Instead you should use Slf4j's formatting anchors to log. The advantage is the `toString()` method is not called unless the message will be logged.

[source,groovy]
----
log.info "{}", 9.2D
log.debug "Key: {}, Value: {}", key, value
log.error "{}", exception.message, exception
----

See the http://www.slf4j.org/faq.html#string_or_object[Slf4j FAQ] for more information.


==== Spring 4.3


Grails 3.2 comes with Spring 4.3 which no longer supports Hibernate 3 and hence Grails 3.2 no longer supports Hibernate 3 either and you will need to upgrade to Hibernate 4 or above.


==== Spring Boot 1.4


Spring Boot 1.4, through its dependency management mechanism, enforces the upgrade for many depndencies. You should review your dependencies following the upgrade to ensure the new versions are compatible with your application.

Spring Boot 1.4 also deprecates many testing annotations (such as `WebIntegrationTest`).

See the https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-1.4-Release-Notes[Spring Boot 1.4 release notes] for more information on the changes required at the Boot level.



==== Hibernate 4 Usage


Related to Spring Boot 1.4, one important change is that Hibernate 5 is now the default version, so if you have declared a dependency on the `hibernate4` plugin in Grails such as:

[source,groovy]
----
compile "org.grails.plugins:hibernate4"
----

This will not be enough to ensure that Hibernate 4 is used. You must instead also directly declare the Hibernate 4 dependencies:

[source,groovy]
----
dependencies {
    compile "org.grails.plugins:hibernate4"
    compile "org.hibernate:hibernate-core:4.3.10.Final"
    compile "org.hibernate:hibernate-ehcache:4.3.10.Final"
}
----


==== GORM 6 Configuration Model


In preparation for Hibernate 5.2 support the previous "SessionFactoryBean" notion has been removed. Now if you wish to customize `SessionFactory` creation you should instead register a custom `org.grails.orm.hibernate.connections.HibernateConnectionSourceFactory` in Spring.


==== HibernateTestMixin Dependency Changes


The `grails-datastore-test-support` dependency has been removed and the `HibernateTestMixin` class integrated directly into the plugin, so if you receive a resolve error remove the following dependency from your `build.gradle`:

[source,groovy]
----
dependencies {
    testCompile "org.grails:grails-datastore-test-support"
}
----


==== `application.groovy` Changes


An improvement was added to make groovy configuration behave like yml configuration when it comes to the CLI. Previously, configuration values in `application.groovy` were not available to commands like `grails create-controller`. A side effect of this change causes an exception when those commands are executed if the configuration relies on classes in the runtime.

[source,groovy]
----
Error occurred running Grails CLI: startup failed:
script14738267015581837265078.groovy: 13: unable to resolve class com.foo.Bar
----

The solution is to create a separate file called `runtime.groovy` in `grails-app/conf`. That file will not be parsed by the CLI and will only be included at runtime.

==== Stop using the default namespace

Using the default package in places like `UrlMappings.groovy`, `BootStrap.groovy` or in a taglib can cause that code to fail or not execute at all when packaged in a JAR or WAR file. Make sure all Groovy/Java files start with the `package` statement and move any affected files to the respective folder. For example, change:

[source,groovy]
----
class UrlMappings {

    static mappings = {
    
    ...
----

to:

[source,groovy]
----
package myapp

class UrlMappings {

    static mappings = {
    
    ...
----

and copy the file from `grails-app/controllers/UrlMappings.groovy` into `.grails-app/controllers/myapp/UrlMappings.groovy`
