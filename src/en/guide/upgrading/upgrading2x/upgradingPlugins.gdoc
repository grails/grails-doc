To upgrade a Grails 2.x plugin to Grails 3.x you need to make a number of different changes. This documentation will outline the steps that were taken to upgrade the Quartz plugin to Grails 3, each individual plugin may differ.

h4. Step 1 - Create a new Grails 3 plugin

The first step is to create a new Grails 3 plugin using the command line:

{code}
$ grails create-plugin quartz
{code}

This will create a Grails 3 plugin in the @quartz@ directory.

h4. Step 2 - Copy sources from the original Grails 2 plugin

The next step is to copy the sources from the original Grails 2 plugin to the Grails 3 plugin:

{code}
# first the sources
cp -rf ../quartz-2.x/src/groovy/ src/main/groovy
cp -rf ../quartz-2.x/src/java/ src/main/groovy
cp -rf ../quartz-2.x/grails-app/ grails-app
cp -rf ../quartz-2.x/QuartzGrailsPlugin.groovy src/main/groovy/grails/plugins/quartz

# then the tests
cp -rf ../quartz-2.x/test/unit/* src/test/groovy
mkdir -p src/integration-test/groovy
cp -rf ../quartz-2.x/test/integration/* src/integration-test/groovy

# then templates / other resources
cp -rf ../quartz-2.x/src/templates/ src/main/templates
{code}

h4. Step 3 - Alter the plugin descriptor

You will need to add a package declaration to the plugin descriptor. In this case @QuartzGrailsPlugin@ is modified as follows:

{code}
// add package declaration
package grails.plugins.quartz
...
class QuartzGrailsPlugin {
 ...
}
{code}

In addition you should remove the @version@ property from the descriptor as this is now defined in @build.gradle@.

h4. Step 4 - Update the Gradle build with required dependencies

The repositories and dependencies defined in @grails-app/conf/BuildConfig.groovy@ of the original Grails 2.x plugin will need to be defined in @build.gradle@ of the new Grails 3.x plugin:

{code}
  compile("org.quartz-scheduler:quartz:2.2.1") {
    exclude group: 'slf4j-api', module: 'c3p0'
  }
{code}

h4. Step 5 - Modify Package Imports

In Grails 3.x all internal APIs can be found in the @org.grails@ package and public facing APIs in the @grails@ package. The @org.codehaus.groovy.grails@ package no longer exists.

All package declaration in sources should be modified for the new location of the respective classes. Example @org.codehaus.groovy.grails.commons.GrailsApplication@ is now @grails.core.GrailsApplication@.

h4. Step 5 - Migrate Plugin Specific Config to application.yml

Some plugins define a default configuration file. For example the Quartz plugin defines a file called @grails-app/conf/DefaultQuartzConfig.groovy@. In Grails 3.x this default configuration can be migrated to @grails-app/conf/application.yml@ and it will automatically be loaded by Grails without requiring manual configuration merging.

h4. Step 6 - Register ArtefactHandler Definitions

In Grails 3.x [ArtefactHandler|api:grails.core.ArtefactHandler] definitions written in Java need to be declared in a file called @src/main/resources/META-INF/grails.factories@ since these need to be known at compile time.

{note}
If the @ArtefactHandler@ is written in Groovy this step can be skipped as Grails will automatically create the @grails.factories@ file during compilation.
{note}

The Quartz plugin requires the following definition to register the @ArtrefactHandler@:

{code}
grails.core.ArtefactHandler=grails.plugins.quartz.JobArtefactHandler
{code}

h4. Step 7 - Migrate Code Generation Scripts

Many plugins previously defined command line scripts in Gant. In Grails 3.x command line scripts have been replaced by two new features: Code generation scripts and Gradle tasks.

If your script is doing simple code generation then for many cases a code generation script can replace an old Gant script.

The @create-job@ script provided by the Quartz plugin in Grails 2.x was defined in @scripts/CreateJob.groovy@ as:

{code}
includeTargets << grailsScript("_GrailsCreateArtifacts")

target(createJob: "Creates a new Quartz scheduled job") {
    depends(checkVersion, parseArguments)

    def type = "Job"
    promptForName(type: type)

    for (name in argsMap.params) {
        name = purgeRedundantArtifactSuffix(name, type)
        createArtifact(name: name, suffix: type, type: type, path: "grails-app/jobs")
        createUnitTest(name: name, suffix: type)
    }
}

setDefaultTarget 'createJob'
{code}

A replacement Grails 3.x compatible script can be created using the @create-script@ command:

{code}
$ grails create-script create-job
{code}

Which creates a new script called @src/main/scripts/create-job.groovy@. Using the new code generation API it is simple to implement:

{code}
description("Creates a new Quartz scheduled job") {
    usage "grails create-job [JOB NAME]"
    argument name:'Job Name', description:"The name of the job"
}

model = model( args[0] )
render  template:"Job.groovy",
        destination: file( "grails-app/jobs/$model.packagePath/${model.simpleName}Job.groovy"),
        model: model
{code}

Please refer to the documentation on [Creating Custom Scripts|guide:creatingCustomScripts] for more information.

h4. Migrating More Complex Scripts Using Gradle Tasks

Using the old Grails 2.x build system it was relatively common to spin up Grails inside the command line. In Grails 3.x it is not possible to load a Grails application within a code generation script created by the [create-script|commandLine] command.

Instead a new mechanism specific to plugins exists via the [create-command|commandLine] command. The @create-command@ command will create a new [ApplicationCommand|api:grails.dev.commands.ApplicationCommand], for example the following command will execute a query:

{code}
import grails.dev.commands.*
import javax.sql.*
import groovy.sql.*
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.*

class RunQueryCommand implements ApplicationCommand {

  @Autowired
  DataSource dataSource

  boolean handle(ExecutionContext ctx) {
      def sql = new Sql(dataSource)
      println sql.executeQuery("select * from foo")
      return true
  }
}
{code}

With this command in place once the plugin is installed into your local Maven cache you can add the plugin to both the build classpath and the runtime classpath of the application's @build.gradle@ file:

{code}
buildscript {
  ...
  dependencies {
    classpath "org.grails.plugins:myplugin:0.1-SNAPSHOT"
  }
}
...
dependencies {
  runtime "org.grails.plugins:myplugin:0.1-SNAPSHOT"
}
{code}

Grails will automatically create a Gradle task called @runQuery@ and a command named @run-query@ so both the following examples will execute the command:

{code}
$ grails run-query
$ gradle runQuery
{code}

h4. Step 8 - Delete Files that were migrated or no longer used

You should now delete and cleanup the project of any files no longer required by Grails 3.x (@BuildConfig.groovy@, @Config.groovy@, @DataSource.groovy@ etc.)
