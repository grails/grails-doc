https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/production-ready-endpoints.html[Spring Boot Actuator endpoints] allow you to monitor and interact with your application. Spring Boot includes a number of built-in endpoints. For example the `health` endpoint provides basic application health information.

These endpoints are disabled by default since Grails 3.1.8. 

You can enable actuator endpoints in your `application.yml` as follows:

[source,yml]
.grails-app/conf/application.yml
----
endpoints:
    enabled: true
