[Domain classes|guide:domainClasses] and [command objects|guide:commandObjects] support validation by default.  Other classes may be made validateable by defining the static @constraints@ property in the class (as described above) and then telling the framework about them.  It is important that the application register the validateable classes with the framework.  Simply defining the @constraints@ property is not sufficient.

h4. The Validateable Trait

Classes which define the static @constraints@ property and implement the [Validateable|api:grails.validation.Validateable] trait will be validateable. Consider this example:

{code:java}
// src/groovy/com/mycompany/myapp/User.groovy
package com.mycompany.myapp

import grails.validation.Validateable

class User implements Validateable {
    ...

    static constraints = {
        login size: 5..15, blank: false, unique: true
        password size: 5..15, blank: false
        email email: true, blank: false
        age min: 18
    }
}
{code}
