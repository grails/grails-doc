Another important thing to note about errors in Grails is that error messages are not hard coded anywhere. The http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/validation/FieldError.html[FieldError] class in Spring resolves messages from message bundles using Grails' <<i18n,i18n>> support.


==== Constraints and Message Codes


The codes themselves are dictated by a convention. For example consider the constraints we looked at earlier:

[source,java]
----
package com.mycompany.myapp

class User {
    ...

    static constraints = {
        login size: 5..15, blank: false, unique: true
        password size: 5..15, blank: false
        email email: true, blank: false
        age min: 18
    }
}
----

If a constraint is violated Grails will by convention look for a message code of the form:

[source,java]
----
<<Class Name>>.<<Property Name>>.<<Constraint Code>>
----

In the case of the `blank` constraint this would be `user.login.blank` so you would need a message such as the following in your `grails-app/i18n/messages.properties` file:

[source,java]
----
user.login.blank=Your login name must be specified!
----

The class name is looked for both with and without a package, with the packaged version taking precedence. So for example, com.mycompany.myapp.User.login.blank will be used before user.login.blank. This allows for cases where your domain class message codes clash with a plugin's.

For a reference on what codes are for which constraints refer to the reference guide for each constraint (e.g. link:../ref/Constraints/blank.html[blank]).


==== Displaying Messages


The link:../ref/Tags/renderErrors.html[renderErrors] tag will automatically look up messages for you using the link:../ref/Tags/message.html[message] tag. If you need more control of rendering you can handle this yourself:

[source,xml]
----
<g:hasErrors bean="${user}">
  <ul>
   <g:eachError var="err" bean="${user}">
       <li><g:message error="${err}" /></li>
   </g:eachError>
  </ul>
</g:hasErrors>
----

In this example within the body of the link:../ref/Tags/eachError.html[eachError] tag we use the link:../ref/Tags/message.html[message] tag in combination with its `error` argument to read the message for the given error.
