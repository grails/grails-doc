<<GORM,Domain classes>> and <<commandObjects,command objects>> support validation by default.  Other classes may be made validateable by defining the static `constraints` property in the class (as described above) and then telling the framework about them.  It is important that the application register the validateable classes with the framework.  Simply defining the `constraints` property is not sufficient.


==== The Validateable Trait


Classes which define the static `constraints` property and implement the http://docs.grails.org/latest/api/grails/validation/Validateable.html[Validateable] trait will be validateable. Consider this example:

[source,java]
----
// src/groovy/com/mycompany/myapp/User.groovy
package com.mycompany.myapp

import grails.validation.Validateable

class User implements Validateable {
    ...

    static constraints = {
        login size: 5..15, blank: false, unique: true
        password size: 5..15, blank: false
        email email: true, blank: false
        age min: 18
    }
}
