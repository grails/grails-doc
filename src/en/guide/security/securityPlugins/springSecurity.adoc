The Spring Security plugins are built on the http://projects.spring.io/spring-security/[Spring Security] project which provides a flexible, extensible framework for building all sorts of authentication and authorization schemes. The plugins are modular so you can install just the functionality that you need for your application. The Spring Security plugins are the official security plugins for Grails and are actively maintained and supported.

There is a https://plugins.grails.org/plugin/grails/spring-security-core[Core plugin] which supports form-based authentication, encrypted/salted passwords, HTTP Basic authentication, etc. and secondary dependent plugins provide alternate functionality such as https://grails.org/plugins.html#plugin/spring-security-acl[ACL support], https://plugins.grails.org/plugin/grails/spring-security-cas[single sign-on with Apereo CAS], https://plugins.grails.org/plugin/grails/spring-security-ldap[LDAP authentication], https://plugins.grails.org/plugin/grails/spring-security-kerberos[Kerberos authentication], and a plugin providing https://plugins.grails.org/plugin/grails/spring-security-ui[user interface extensions] and security workflows.

See the https://plugins.grails.org/plugin/grails/spring-security-kerberoscore[Core plugin page] for basic information and the http://grails-plugins.github.io/grails-spring-security-core/[user guide] for detailed information.
