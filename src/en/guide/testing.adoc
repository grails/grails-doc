Automated testing is a critical aspect of Grails development. Grails provides a rich set of testing capabilities, ranging from low-level unit testing to high-level functional tests. This comprehensive guide explores these diverse testing features in detail.

**Automatic Test Generation**

When you use the `create-*` and `generate-*` commands, Grails automatically generates `unit` or `integration` tests. For example, running the `create-controller` command as shown below:

[source,shell]
----
grails create-controller com.example.simple
----

Grails generates a controller at grails-app/controllers/com/example/SimpleController.groovy and a corresponding unit test at src/test/groovy/com/example/SimpleControllerSpec.groovy. It's important to note that Grails only creates the test structure; you need to implement the test logic.

**Running Tests**

To execute tests, you can use the Gradle check task:

[source,shell]
----
./gradlew check
----

This command will execute all the Unit tests in src/main/groovy/com/example/ directory.


=== Targeting Tests

To selectively target tests for execution, you have several options:

1. To run all tests for a controller named SimpleController, use this command:
+
[source,shell]
----
./gradlew check --tests SimpleController
----

2. To test all classes ending in Controller, you can employ wildcards:
+
[source,shell]
----
./gradlew check --tests *Controller
----

3. To specify package names:
+
[source,shell]
----
./gradlew check --tests some.org.*Controller
----

4. To run all tests in a package:
+
[source,shell]
----
./gradlew check --tests some.org.*
----

5. To run all tests in a package, including subpackages:
+
[source,shell]
----
./gradlew check --tests some.org.**.*
----

6. To target specific test methods:
+
[source,shell]
----
./gradlew check --tests SimpleController.testLogin
----

You can combine multiple patterns as needed:

[source,shell]
----
./gradlew check --tests some.org.* SimpleController.testLogin BookController
----

NOTE: You might need to specify the package name before the class name and append "Spec" to it. For instance, to run the test for the ProductController, use ./gradlew test *.ProductControllerSpec. You can also use the star wildcard if you want to avoid typing the entire package hierarchy.

=== Debugging

To debug your tests using a remote debugger, you can add `--debug-jvm` after `./gradlew` in any commands, like so:

[source,shell]
----
./gradlew check --debug-jvm
----

This will open the default Java remote debugging port, 5005, allowing you to attach a remote debugger from your code editor or integrated development environment.

=== Targeting Test Phases / Running Unit & Integration Separately

To execute "unit" tests, use this command:

[source,shell]
----
./gradlew test
----

For "integration" tests, you would run:

[source,shell]
----
./gradlew integrationTest
----

=== Targeting Tests When Using Phases

You can combine test and phase targeting:

[source,shell]
----
./gradlew test some.org.**.* -unit
----

This command will run all tests in the unit phase within the some.org package or its subpackages. For more detailed information, it's recommended to consult the Gradle documentation on https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/java_testing.html[Testing in Java & JVM projects].
