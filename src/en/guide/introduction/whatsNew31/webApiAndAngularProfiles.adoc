==== REST Profile


A new profile is available designed for the creation of pure REST applications without a UI.

To create a REST application use the `rest-api` profile as an argument to link:../ref/Command%20Line/create-app.html[create-app]:

[source,groovy]
----
$ grails create-app myapp --profile=rest-api
----

NOTE: In earlier milestones this profile was named web-api. The profile has been renamed `rest-api` which more appropriately describes its purpose.

Then start interactive mode to see the available commands for the profile:

[source,groovy]
----
$ cd myapp
$ grails
----

If you hit TAB you will notice code generation commands specific to the profile including:

* `create-domain-resource` - Creates a domain class annotated with the http://docs.grails.org/latest/api/grails/rest/Resource.html[Resource] annotation)
* `create-restful-controller` - Creates a controller that extends http://docs.grails.org/latest/api/grails/rest/RestfulController.html[RestfulController].


==== JSON and Markup Views


The REST profile includes the ability to define <<ref-comgrailsgrailsviews-JSON and Markup views,JSON and Markup views>> and the `build.gradle` features the ability to compile these views for production use.

The REST profile also creates https://github.com/grails/grails-views[JSON views] to render the `index` action and common commands such as link:../ref/Command%20Line/generate-views.html[generate-views] have been overridden to generate JSON views.


==== AngularJS Profile


An initial version of the AngularJS profile is now available, making it easier to create and integrate AngularJS with Grails 3 applications.

To create a Grails 3 AngularJS application use the `angular` profile as an argument to link:../ref/Command%20Line/create-app.html[create-app]:

[source,groovy]
----
$ grails create-app myapp --profile=angular
----

Then start interactive mode to see the available commands for the profile:

[source,groovy]
----
$ cd myapp
$ grails
----


You will notice new commands such as `create-ng-component`, `create-ng-controller` etc. that help you get going creating an AngularJS application.

The `build.gradle` is also preconfigured with the necessary Gradle plugins to integrate AngularJS with Asset Pipeline. The created Angular application can be found in `grails-app/assets/javascripts`.
