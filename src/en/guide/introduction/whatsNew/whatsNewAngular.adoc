The `angular` profile has been refined and now also includes a new https://grails.org/plugins.html#plugin/angular-scaffolding[Angular Scaffolding] plugin.

The Angular scaffolding plugin adds an `ng-generate-all` command which will generate the necessary AngularJS 1.x client code to perform CRUD operations in conjunction with a Grails 3 backend.

Not only does this serve as a useful tool to get up and running quickly, but (like previous versions of scaffolding) it is a great way for developers to learn how to integrate AngularJS and Grails 3.

TIP: Support for Angular 2 is planned for the future.
