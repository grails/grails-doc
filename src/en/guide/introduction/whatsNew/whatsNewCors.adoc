Starting with Grails 3.2.1, we have added support to configure the CORS support provided in Spring Boot.

This feature is disabled by default. Once enabled, the default setting is "wide open". To enable CORS configuration:

[source,yaml]
.application.yml
----
grails:
    cors:
        enabled: true
----

To get more information on how to tighten down these settings to match your needs, visit the section on link:theWebLayer.html#cors[configuring CORS].
