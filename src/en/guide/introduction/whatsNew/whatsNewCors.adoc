Starting with Grails 3.2.1, we have added support to configure the CORS support provided in Spring Boot.

This feature is disabled by default. Once enabled, the default setting is "wide open". To enable CORS configuration:

[source,yaml]
.application.yml
----
grails:
    cors:
        enabled: true
----
