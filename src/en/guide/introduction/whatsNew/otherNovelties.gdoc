h4. New default date data binding format

Dates formatted like "1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z" will now be successfully parsed by default. The format is used by common JavaScript libraries.

h4. The @run-script@ command from Grails 2 is back

The @run-script@ command makes a return! It is now possible to run Groovy scripts that are wrapped in a Grails context using Grails 3:

{code}
$ grails run-script my-groovy-script.groovy
{code}

Refer to the [run-script|commandLine] documentation for more information.

h4. REST Profile Refinements

The REST profile has been further refined including more sensible @UrlMappings@ and mime type configuration designed specifically for REST applications.

h4. Ability to skip the Bootstrap process with a system property

When the Grails runtime is started, it will now execute @*Bootstrap.groovy@ classes conditionally. If the system property @grails.bootstrap.skip@ is set to @true@, the classes will _not_ be executed for that run.

h4. Changes to data binding with the body of a request

To be more inline with the [HTTP/1.1|https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-4.3] specification, request bodies in GET and DELETE requests will be ignored for data binding. The request body will also be ignored if the specified content length is 0.

h4. Profile improvements

It is now possible to specify credentials for repositories used for profile resolution in your @settings.groovy@ file. See the [section on profiles|guide:profiles] for documentation.
