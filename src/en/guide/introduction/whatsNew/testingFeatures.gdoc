h4. Integration and Geb Functional Tests

Grails 3.0 supports built in support for Spock/Geb functional tests using the [create-functional-test|commandLine] command. Functional tests are based on Spring Boot's test running mechanism and load the application just once for an entire suite of tests. The tests can be run from and IDE and don't require the command line.

h4. Gradle Test Running

Since Grails 3.0 is built on Gradle the test execution configuration is much more flexible and can easily configured to execute in parallel.
