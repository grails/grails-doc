h4. New Interceptors API

In previous versions of Grails, filters were used to define logic that intercepts controller action execution.

As of Grails 3.0, this API is deprecated and has been replaced by the new [Interceptor API|guide:interceptors]. An example interceptor can be seen below:

{code}
 class MyInterceptor {

  boolean before() { true }

  boolean after() { true }

  void afterView() {
    // no-op
  }

}
{code}
