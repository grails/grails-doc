The @angular@ profile has been refined and now also includes a new [Angular Scaffolding|https://grails.org/plugins.html#plugin/angular-scaffolding] plugin.

The Angular scaffolding plugin adds an @ng-generate-all@ command which will generate the necessary AngularJS 1.x client code to perform CRUD operations in conjunction with a Grails 3 backend.

Not only does this serve as a useful tool to get up and running quickly, but (like previous versions of scaffolding) it is a great way for developers to learn how to integrate AngularJS and Grails 3.

{note}
Support for Angular 2 is planned for the future.
