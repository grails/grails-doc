==== The Basics


Testing URL mappings can be done with the `TestFor` annotation testing a particular URL mappings class. For example to test the default URL mappings you can do the following:

[source,java]
----
import com.demo.SimpleController
import grails.test.mixin.TestFor
import grails.test.mixin.Mock
import spock.lang.Specification

@TestFor(UrlMappings)
@Mock(SimpleController)
class UrlMappingsSpec extends Specification {
    // ...
}
----

As you can see, any controller that is the target of a URL mapping that you're testing _must_ be added to the `@Mock` annotation.

NOTE: Note that since the default `UrlMappings` class is in the default package your test must also be in the default package

With that done there are a number of useful methods that are defined by the `grails.test.mixin.web.UrlMappingsUnitTestMixin` for testing URL mappings. These include:

* `assertForwardUrlMapping` - Asserts a URL mapping is forwarded for the given controller class (note that controller will need to be defined as a mock collaborate for this to work)
* `assertReverseUrlMapping` - Asserts that the given URL is produced when reverse mapping a link to a given controller and action
* `assertUrlMapping` - Asserts a URL mapping is valid for the given URL. This combines the `assertForwardUrlMapping` and `assertReverseUrlMapping` assertions


==== Asserting Forward URL Mappings


You use `assertForwardUrlMapping` to assert that a given URL maps to a given controller. For example, consider the following URL mappings:

[source,java]
----
static mappings = {
    "/actionOne"(controller: "simple", action: "action1")
    "/actionTwo"(controller: "simple", action: "action2")
}
----

The following test can be written to assert these URL mappings:

[source,java]
----
import com.demo.SimpleController
import grails.test.mixin.TestFor
import grails.test.mixin.Mock
import spock.lang.Specification

@TestFor(UrlMappings)
@Mock(SimpleController)
class UrlMappingsSpec extends Specification {

    void "test forward mappings"() {
        expect:
        assertForwardUrlMapping("/actionOne", controller: 'simple', action: "action1")
        assertForwardUrlMapping("/actionTwo", controller: 'simple', action: "action2")
    }
}
----


==== Assert Reverse URL Mappings


You use `assertReverseUrlMapping` to check that correct links are produced for your URL mapping when using the `link` tag in GSP views. An example test is largely identical to the previous listing except you use `assertReverseUrlMapping` instead of `assertForwardUrlMapping`. Note that you can combine these 2 assertions with `assertUrlMapping`.
