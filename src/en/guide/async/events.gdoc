Grails 3.0 introduces a new Events API based on [Reactor|https://github.com/reactor/reactor].

All services and controllers in Grails 3.0 implement the [Events|api:grails.events.Events] trait.

The @Events@ trait allows the ability to consume and publish events that are handled by Reactor.

The default Reactor configuration utilises a thread pool backed event bus. You can however configure Reactor within @application.yml@, for example:

{code}
reactor:
    dispatchers:
        default: myExecutor
        myExecutor:
            type: threadPoolExecutor
            size: 5
            backlog: 2048
{code}
