There are several ways to consume an event. As mentioned previously services and controllers implement the http://docs.grails.org/latest/api/grails/events/Events.html[Events] trait.

The `Events` trait provides several methods to register event consumers. For example:

[source,groovy]
----
on("myEvent") {
    println "Event fired!"
}
----

Note that if you wish a class (other than a controller or service) to be an event consumer you simply have to implement the `Events` trait and ensure the class is registered as a Spring bean.

For example given the following class:

[source,groovy]
----
import grails.events.*
import javax.annotation.*

class MyClass implements Events {

	@PostConstruct
	void init() {
		on("myEvent") {
		    println "Event fired!"
		}		
	}	
}
----

You can override `doWithSpring` in your `Application` class to register it as a Spring bean (or annotate it with `Component`):

[source,groovy]
----
Closure doWithSpring() {
        {->
    		myClass(MyClass)
        }
    }
