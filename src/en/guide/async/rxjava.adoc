Since Grails 3.2, you can use https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava[RxJava] to write reactive logic in your Grails controllers that leverages the underlying containers asynchronous processing capabilities.

To get started simply declare a dependency on the plugin in `build.gradle`:

[source,groovy]
.build.gradle
----
dependencies {
    ...
    compile 'org.grails.plugins:rxjava'
}
----

You can then return `rx.Observable` as a return value from any controller and Grails will automatically apply the following steps:

1. Create a new asynchronous request
2. Spawn a new thread that subscribes to the observable
3. When the observable omits a result process the result using the link:../ref/Controllers/respond.html[respond] method.

For more detailed instructions on how to use the RxJava plugin see the https://grails-plugins.github.io/grails-rxjava/latest/[user guide documentation] for the plugin.
