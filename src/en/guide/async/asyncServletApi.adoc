In addition to the higher level async features discussed earlier in the section, you can access the raw Servlet 3.0 asynchronous API from a Grails application.


==== Servlet 3.0 Asynchronous Rendering


You can render content (templates, binary data etc.) in an asynchronous manner by calling the `startAsync` method which returns an instance of the Servlet 3.0 `AsyncContext`. Once you have a reference to the `AsyncContext` you can use Grails' regular render method to render content:

[source,groovy]
----
def index() {
    def ctx = startAsync()
    ctx.start {
        new Book(title:"The Stand").save()
        render template:"books", model:[books:Book.list()]
        ctx.complete()
    }
}
----

Note that you must call the `complete()` method to terminate the connection. 


==== Resuming an Async Request


You resume processing of an async request (for example to delegate to view rendering) by using the `dispatch` method of the `AsyncContext` class:

[source,groovy]
----
def index() {
    def ctx = startAsync()
    ctx.start {
        // do working
        ...
        // render view
        ctx.dispatch()
    }
}
----
