Grails 3.0 introduces a new Events API based on <<ref-comreactorreactor-Reactor,Reactor>>.

All services and controllers in Grails 3.0 implement the http://docs.grails.org/latest/api/grails/events/Events.html[Events] trait.

The `Events` trait allows the ability to consume and publish events that are handled by Reactor.

The default Reactor configuration utilises a thread pool backed event bus. You can however configure Reactor within `application.yml`, for example:

[source,groovy]
----
reactor:
    dispatchers:
        default: myExecutor
        myExecutor:
            type: threadPoolExecutor
            size: 5
            backlog: 2048
----
