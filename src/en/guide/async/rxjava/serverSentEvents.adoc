Server-sent events (SSE) is a technology where a browser receives automatic updates from a server via HTTP connection. The Server-Sent Events EventSource API is standardized as part of HTML5 by the W3C.


The https://grails-plugins.github.io/grails-rxjava/latest/[RxJava plugin] adds support for SSE to Grails making it simple to write controllers that maintain continuous non-blocking communication with a JavaScript client.


For example:

[source,groovy]
----
def index() {

    rx.stream { Subscriber subscriber -> <1>
       for(i in (0..5)) {
           if(i % 2 == 0) {
               subscriber.onNext(
                   rx.render("Tick") <2>
               )
           }
           else {
               subscriber.onNext(
                   rx.render("Tock")
               )

           }
           sleep 1000 <3>
       }
       subscriber.onCompleted() <4>
   }
}
----

<1> Call the `stream` method passing a closure that accepts an `rx.Subscriber` to start sending events
<2> Emit a one or many items using `onNext`
<3> Call `sleep` to simulate a slow request
<4> Call `onCompleted` to complete the request

For more detailed instructions on how to use SSE and the RxJava plugin see the https://grails-plugins.github.io/grails-rxjava/latest/[user guide documentation] for the plugin.
