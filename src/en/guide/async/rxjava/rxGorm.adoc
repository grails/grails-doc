http://gorm.grails.org/6.0.x/rx/manual/[RxGORM] is new implementation of GORM that has the following goals:

* Reactive
* Non-blocking
* Stateless
* Simple

RxGORM, unlike the link:async.html#asyncGorm[Asynchronous GORM] implementation, aims to be truly non-blocking, down to the driver level.

The following in an example of RxGORM in action:

[source,groovy]
----
Book.get(id)
    .subscribe { Book it ->
    println "Title = ${it.title}"
}
----

You can combine RxGORM with the https://grails-plugins.github.io/grails-rxjava/latest[RxJava] plugin to implement reactive responses from Grails controllers. For example:

[source,groovy]
----
def show() {
	// returns an rx.Observable
    Book.get(params.id?.toString())
}
----

For more information on how to use RxGORM, see the http://gorm.grails.org/6.0.x/rx/manual/[RxGORM user guide].
