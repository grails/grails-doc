You can create your own commands by running the <<ref-command-line-create-command,create-command>> command from the root of your project. For example the following command will create a command called `grails-app/commands/HelloWorldCommand`:

[source,groovy]
----
grails create-command HelloWorld
----

NOTE: Unlike scripts, commands cause the Grails environment to start and you have full access to the application context and the runtime.

Since Grails 3.2.0, commands have similar abilities as scripts in regards to retrieving arguments, template generation, file access, and model building.

If you created a command in a previous version of grails, you can update your command to have those abilities by changing which trait you are implementing.

Commands created in Grails 3.1.x or lower implement the http://docs.grails.org/latest/api/grails/dev/commands/ApplicationCommand.html[ApplicationCommand] trait by default which requires your command to implement the following method:

[source,groovy]
----
boolean handle(ExecutionContext executionContext)
----

Commands created in Grails 3.2.0 or higher implement the http://docs.grails.org/latest/api/grails/dev/commands/GrailsApplicationCommand.html[GrailsApplicationCommand] trait by default which requires your command to implement the following method:

[source,groovy]
----
boolean handle()
----

NOTE: Commands defined this way still have access to the execution context via a variable called "executionContext".
