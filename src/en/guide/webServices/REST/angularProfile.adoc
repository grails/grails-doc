Since Grails 3.1, Grails supports a profile for creating applications with AngularJS that provides a more focused set of dependencies and commands. The angular profile inherits from the REST profile and therefore has all of the commands and properties that the REST profile has.

To get started with the Angular profile, create an application specifying `angular` as the name of the profile:

[source,groovy]
----
$ grails create-app my-api --profile angular
----

This will create a new Grails application that provides the following features:

* Default set of commands for creating Angular artefacts
* Gradle plugin to manage client side dependencies
* Gradle plugin to execute client side unit tests
* Asset Pipeline plugins to ease development

By default the Angular profile includes GSP support in order to render the index page. This is necessary because the profile is designed around asset pipeline.

The new commands are:

* `create-ng-component`
* `create-ng-controller`
* `create-ng-directive`
* `create-ng-domain`
* `create-ng-module`
* `create-ng-service`



==== Project structure


The Angular profile is designed around a specific project structure. The `create-ng` commands will automatically create modules where they do not exist.

Example:
[source,groovy]
----
$ grails create-ng-controller foo
----

This will produce a `fooController.js` file in `grails-app/assets/javascripts/${default package name}/controllers`.

NOTE: By default the angular profile will create files in the `javascripts` directory. You can change that behavior in your configuration with the key `grails.codegen.angular.assetDir`.

[source,groovy]
----
$ grails create-ng-domain foo.bar
----

This will produce a `Bar.js` file in `grails-app/assets/javascripts/foo/domains`. It will also create the "foo" module if it does not already exist.

[source,groovy]
----
$ grails create-ng-module foo.bar
----

This will produce a `foo.bar.js` file in `grails-app/assets/javascripts/foo/bar`. Note the naming convention for modules is different than other artefacts.

[source,groovy]
----
$ grails create-ng-service foo.bar --type constant
----

This will produce a `bar.js` file in `grails-app/assets/javascripts/foo/services`. It will also create the "foo" module if it does not already exist. The `create-ng-service` command accepts a flag `-type`. The types that can be used are:

* service
* factory _default_
* value
* provider
* constant

Along with the artefacts themselves, the profile will also produce a skeleton unit test file under `src/test/javascripts` for each create command.


==== Client side dependencies


The <<ref-comcraigburkebowerinstallergradle-Gradle Bower Plugin,Gradle Bower Plugin>> is used to manage dependencies with bower. Visit the plugin documentation to learn how to use the plugin.


==== Unit Testing


The https://github.com/craigburke/karma-gradle[Gradle Karma Plugin] is used to execute client side unit tests. All generated tests are written with Jasmine. Visit the plugin documentation to learn how to use the plugin.


==== Asset Pipeline


The Angular profile includes several asset pipeline plugins to make development easier.

* https://github.com/craigburke/js-closure-wrap-asset-pipeline[JS Closure Wrap Asset Pipeline] will wrap your Angular code in immediately invoked function expressions.
* https://github.com/craigburke/angular-annotate-asset-pipeline[Annotate Asset Pipeline] will annotate your dependencies to be safe for minification.
* https://github.com/craigburke/angular-template-asset-pipeline[Template Asset Pipelin] will put your templates into the `$templateCache` to prevent http requests to retrieve the templates.
