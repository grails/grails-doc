As mentioned in the previous section the REST profile by default uses JSON views to render JSON responses. These play a similar role to GSP, but instead are optimized for outputing JSON responses instead of HTML.

You can continue to separate your application in terms of MVC, with the logic of your application residing in controllers and services, whilst view related matters are handled by JSON views.

JSON views also provide the flexibility to easily customize the JSON presented to clients without having to resort to relatively complex marshalling libraries like Jackson or Grails' marshaller API.

{note}
Since Grails 3.1, JSON views are considered by the Grails team the best way to present JSON output for the client, and for that reason the section on writing custom marshallers has been removed from the user guide. If you are looking for information on that topic, see [the Grails 3.0.x guide|http://grails.github.io/grails-doc/3.0.x/guide/webServices.html#objectMarshallers].
