Since Grails 3.1, Grails supports a tailored profile for creating REST applications that provides a more focused set of dependencies and commands.

To get started with the REST profile, create an application specifying `rest-api` as the name of the profile:

[source,groovy]
----
$ grails create-app my-api --profile rest-api
----

This will create a new REST application that provides the following features:

* Default set of commands for creating and generating REST endpoints
* Defaults to using JSON views for rendering responses (see the next section)
* Few plugins than the default Grails plugin (no GSP, no Asset Pipeline, nothing HTML related)

You will notice for example in the `grails-app/views` directory that there are `*.gson` files for rendering the default index page and as well as any 404 and 500 errors.

If you issue the following set of commands:

[source,groovy]
----
$ grails create-domain-class book
$ grails generate-all my.api.Book
----

Instead of CRUD HTML interface a REST endpoint is generated that produces JSON responses. In addition, the generated functional and unit tests by default test the REST endpoint.
