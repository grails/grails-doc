Typically your model may involve one or many domain instances. JSON views provide a render method for rendering these.

For example given the following domain class:

{code}
class Book {
    String title
}
{code}

And the following template:

{code}
model {
    Book book
}

json g.render(book) 
{code}

The resulting output is:

{code}
{id:1,"title":"The Stand"}
{code}

You can customize the rendering by including or excluding properties:

{code}
json g.render(book, [includes:['title']])
{code}

Or by providing a closure to add additional JSON output:

{code}
json g.render(book) {
    pages 1000
}    
{code}
