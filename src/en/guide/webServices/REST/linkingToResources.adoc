The `link` tag offers an easy way to link to any domain class resource:

[source,groovy]
----
<g:link resource="${book}">My Link</g:link>
----

However, currently you cannot use g:link to link to the DELETE action and most browsers do not support sending the DELETE method directly.

The best way to accomplish this is to use a form submit:

[source,groovy]
----
<form action="/book/2" method="post">
 	<input type="hidden" name="_method" value="DELETE"/>
 </form>
----

Grails supports overriding the request method via the hidden _method parameter. This is for browser compatibility purposes. This is useful when using restful resource mappings to create powerful web interfaces.
To make a link fire this type of event, perhaps capture all click events for links with a `data-method` attribute and issue a form submit via javascript.
