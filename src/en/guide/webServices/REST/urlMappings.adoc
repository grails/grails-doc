If you prefer to keep the declaration of the URL mapping in your `UrlMappings.groovy` file then simply removing the `uri` attribute of the `Resource` transformation and adding the following line to `UrlMappings.groovy` will suffice:

[source,groovy]
----
"/books"(resources:"book")
----

Extending your API to include more end points then becomes trivial:

[source,groovy]
----
"/books"(resources:"book") {
    "/publisher"(controller:"publisher", method:"GET")
}
----

The above example will expose the URI `/books/1/publisher`.
