A profile can define new commands that apply only to that profile using YAML or Groovy scripts. Below is an example of the link:../ref/Command%20Line/create-controller.html[create-controller] command defined in YAML:

[source,groovy]
----
description:
    - Creates a controller
    - usage: 'create-controller <<controller name>>'
    - completer: org.grails.cli.interactive.completers.DomainClassCompleter
    - argument: "Controller Name"
      description: "The name of the controller"
steps:
 - command: render
   template: templates/artifacts/Controller.groovy
   destination: grails-app/controllers/`artifact.package.path`/`artifact.name`Controller.groovy
 - command: render
   template: templates/testing/Controller.groovy
   destination: src/test/groovy/`artifact.package.path`/`artifact.name`ControllerSpec.groovy
 - command: mkdir
   location: grails-app/views/`artifact.propertyName`
----

Commands defined in YAML must define one or many steps. Each step is a command in itself. The available step types are:

* `render` - To render a template to a given destination (as seen in the previous example)
* `mkdir` - To make a directory specified by the `location` parameter
* `execute` - To execute a command specified by the `class` parameter. Must be a class that implements the http://docs.grails.org/latest/api/org/grails/cli/profile/Command.html[Command] interface.
* `gradle` - To execute one or many Gradle tasks specified by the `tasks` parameter.

For example to invoke a Gradle task, you can define the following YAML:

[source,groovy]
----
description: Creates a WAR file for deployment to a container (like Tomcat)
minArguments: 0
usage: |
 war
steps:
 - command: gradle
   tasks:
     - war
----

If you need more flexiblity than what the declarative YAML approach provides you can create Groovy script commands. Each Command script is extends from the http://docs.grails.org/latest/api/org/grails/cli/profile/commands/script/GroovyScriptCommmand.html[GroovyScriptCommmand] class and hence has all of the methods of that class available to it.

The following is an example of the link:../ref/Command%20Line/create-script.html[create-script] command written in Groovy:

[source,groovy]
----
description( "Creates a Grails script" ) {
  usage "grails create-script <<SCRIPT NAME>>"
  argument name:'Script Name', description:"The name of the script to create"
  flag name:'force', description:"Whether to overwrite existing files"
}

def scriptName = args<<0>>
def model = model(scriptName)
def overwrite = flag('force') ? true : false

render  template: template('artifacts/Script.groovy'),
        destination: file("src/main/scripts/${model.lowerCaseName}.groovy"),
        model: model,
        overwrite: overwrite
----

For more information on creating CLI commands see the section on <<creatingCustomScripts,Creating custom scripts>> in the Command Line section of the user guide.
