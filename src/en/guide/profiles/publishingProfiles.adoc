==== Publishing Profiles to the Grails Central Repository


Any profile created with the link:../ref/Command%20Line/create-profile.html[create-profile] command already comes configured with a `grails-profile-publish` plugin defined in `build.gradle`:

[source,groovy]
----
apply plugin: "org.grails.grails-profile-publish"
----

To publish a profile using this plugin to the Grails central repository first upload the source to https://github.com[Github] (closed source profiles will not be accepted). Then register for an account on http://bintray.com[Bintray] and configure your keys as follows in the profile's `build.gradle` file:

[source,groovy]
----
grailsPublish {
  user = 'YOUR USERNAME'
  key = 'YOUR KEY'
  githubSlug = 'your-repo/your-profile'
  license = 'Apache-2.0'
}
----

NOTE: The `githubSlug` argument should point to the path to your Github repository. For example if your repository is located at `https://github.com/foo/bar` then your `githubSlug` is `foo/bar`

With this in place you can run `gradle publishProfile` to publish your profile:

[source,groovy]
----
$ gradle publishProfile
----

The profile will be uploaded to Bintray. You can then go the https://github.com/grails-profiles[Grails profiles repository] and request to have your profile included by clicking "Include My Package" button on Bintray's interface (you must be logged in to see this).


==== Publishing Profiles to an Internal Repository


The aforementioned `grails-profile-publish` plugin configures https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/publishing_maven.html[Gradle's Maven Publish plugin]. In order to publish to an internal repository all you need to do is define the repository in `build.gradle`. For example:

[source,groovy]
----
publishing {
    repositories {
        maven {
            credentials {
                username "foo"
                password "bar"
            }

            url "http://foo.com/repo"
        }
    }
}
----

Once configured you can publish your plugin with `gradle publish`:

[source,groovy]
----
$ gradle publish
----
