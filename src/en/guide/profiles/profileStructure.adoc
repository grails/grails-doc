A profile is a simple directory that contains a `profile.yml` file and directories containing the "commands", "skeleton" and "templates" defined by the profile. Example:

[source,groovy]
----
web
    * commands
        * create-controller.yml
        * run-app.groovy    
        ...
    * features
        * asset-pipeline
            * skeleton
            * feature.yml
    * skeleton
        * grails-app
            * controllers
            ...
        * build.gradle
    * templates
        * artifacts
            * Controller.groovy
    * profile.yml
----

The above example is a snippet of structure of the 'web' profile. The `profile.yml` file is used to describe the profile and control how the build is configured.


==== Understanding the profile.yml descriptor


The `profile.yml` can contain the following child elements.


==== 1) repositories


A list of Maven repositories to include in the generated build. Example:

[source,groovy]
----
repositories:
    - "https://repo.grails.org/grails/core"
----


==== 2) build.repositories


A list of Maven repositories to include in the buildscript section of the generated build. Example:

[source,groovy]
----
build:
    repositories:
        - "https://repo.grails.org/grails/core"
----


==== 3) build.plugins


A list of Gradle plugins to configure in the generated build. Example:

[source,groovy]
----
build:
    plugins:
        - eclipse
        - idea
        - org.grails.grails-core
----


==== 4) build.excludes


A list of Gradle plugins to exclude from being inherited from the parent profile:

[source,groovy]
----
build:
    excludes:
        - org.grails.grails-core
----


==== 5) dependencies


A map of scopes and dependencies to configure. The `excludes` scope can be used to exclude from the parent profile. Example:

[source,groovy]
----
dependencies:
    excludes:
        - "org.grails:hibernate"
    build:
        - "org.grails:grails-gradle-plugin:$grailsVersion" 
    compile:
        - "org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-logging"
        - "org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-autoconfigure"
----


==== 6) features.defaults


A default list of features to use if no explicit features are specified.

[source,groovy]
----
features:
    defaults: 
        - hibernate
        - asset-pipeline
----


==== 7) skeleton.excludes


A list of files to exclude from parent profile's skeletons (supports wildcards).

[source,groovy]
----
skeleton:
    excludes:
        - gradlew
        - gradlew.bat
        - gradle/
----


==== 8) skeleton.parent.target


The target folder that parent profile's skeleton should be copied into. This can be used to create multi-project builds.

[source,groovy]
----
skeleton:
    parent:
        target: app
----


==== 9) instructions


Text to be displayed to the user after the application is created

[source,groovy]
----
instructions: Here are some instructions
----


==== What happens when a profile is used?


When the `create-app` command runs it takes the skeleton of the parent profiles and copies the skeletons into a new project structure. 

The `build.gradle` file is generated is result of obtaining all of the dependency information defined in the `profile.yml` files and produces the required dependencies.

The command will also merge any `build.gradle` files defined within a profile and its parent profiles.

The `grails-app/conf/application.yml` file is also merged into a single YAML file taking into account the profile and all of the parent profiles.
