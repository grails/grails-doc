Grails validation capability is built on http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/validation/package-summary.html[Spring's Validator API] and data binding capabilities. However Grails takes this further and provides a unified way to define validation "constraints" with its constraints mechanism.

Constraints in Grails are a way to declaratively specify validation rules. Most commonly they are applied to link:GORM.html[domain classes], however <<urlmappings,URL Mappings>> and <<commandObjects,Command Objects>> also support constraints.
