By default logging in Grails 3.0 is handled by the http://logback.qos.ch[Logback logging framework] and can be configured with the `grails-app/conf/logback.groovy` file.

NOTE: If you prefer XML you can replace the `logback.groovy` file with a `logback.xml` file instead.

For more information on configuring logging refer to the http://logback.qos.ch/manual/groovy.html[Logback documentation] on the subject.
