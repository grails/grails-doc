`application.yml` was introduced in Grails 3.0 for an alternative format for the configuration tasks.


=== Using system properties / command line arguments


Suppose you are using the `JDBC_CONNECTION_STRING` command line argument and you want to access the same in the yml file then it can be done in the following manner:

[source,java]
----
production:
    dataSource: 
        url: '${JDBC_CONNECTION_STRING}'
----

Similarly system arguments can be accessed.

You will need to have this in `build.gradle` to modify the `bootRun` target if `grails run-app` is used to start the application

[source,java]
----
bootRun {
    systemProperties = System.properties
}
----

For testing the following will need to change the `test` task as follows

[source,java]
----
test { 
    systemProperties = System.properties 
}
----
