The `application.yml` file was introduced in Grails 3.0, and YAML is now the preferred format for configuration files.


=== Using system properties / command line arguments


Suppose you are using the `JDBC_CONNECTION_STRING` command line argument and you want to access the same in the yml file then it can be done in the following manner:

[source,yaml]
----
production:
    dataSource: 
        url: '${JDBC_CONNECTION_STRING}'
----

Similarly system arguments can be accessed.

You will need to have this in `build.gradle` to modify the `bootRun` target if `grails run-app` is used to start the application

[source,groovy]
----
bootRun {
    systemProperties = System.properties
}
----

For testing the following will need to change the `test` task as follows

[source,groovy]
----
test { 
    systemProperties = System.properties 
}
----


=== External configuration

Grails will read `application.(properties|yml)` from the `./config` or the current directory by default.
As Grails is a SpringBoot configuration options are available as well, for documentation please consult: {springBootReference}/html/features.html#features.external-config.files
