Grails provides the following GORM configuration options:

* `grails.gorm.failOnError`  - If set to `true`, causes the `save()` method on domain classes to throw a `grails.validation.ValidationException` if link:validation.html[validation] fails during a save.  This option may also be assigned a list of Strings representing package names.  If the value is a list of Strings then the failOnError behavior will only be applied to domain classes in those packages (including sub-packages).  See the link:../ref/Domain%20Classes/save.html[save] method docs for more information.

For example, to enable failOnError for all domain classes:
[source,java]
----
grails:
    gorm:
        failOnError: true
----

and to enable failOnError for domain classes by package:

[source,java]
----
grails:
    gorm:
        failOnError:
            - com.companyname.somepackage
            - com.companyname.someotherpackage
----

* `grails.gorm.autoFlush` - If set to `true`, causes the link:../ref/Domain%20Classes/merge.html[merge], link:../ref/Domain%20Classes/save.html[save] and link:../ref/Domain%20Classes/delete.html[delete] methods to flush the session, replacing the need to explicitly flush using `save(flush: true)`.
