By default logging in Grails 3.0 is handled by the [Logback logging framework|http://logback.qos.ch] and can be configured with the @grails-app/conf/logback.groovy@ file.

{note}
If you prefer XML you can replace the @logback.groovy@ file with a @logback.xml@ file instead.

For more information on configuring logging refer to the [Logback documentation|http://logback.qos.ch/manual/groovy.html] on the subject.
