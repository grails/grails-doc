The http://h2database.com/html/quickstart.html#h2_console[H2 database console] is a convenient feature of H2 that provides a web-based interface to any database that you have a JDBC driver for, and it's very useful to view the database you're developing against. It's especially useful when running against an in-memory database.

You can access the console by navigating to http://localhost:8080/h2-console in a browser. See the {springBootReference}/html/boot-features-sql.html#boot-features-sql-h2-console[Spring Boot H2 Console Documentation] for more information on the options available.
