The http://h2database.com/html/quickstart.html#h2_console[H2 database console] is a convenient feature of H2 that provides a web-based interface to any database that you have a JDBC driver for, and it's very useful to view the database you're developing against. It's especially useful when running against an in-memory database.

You can access the console by navigating to *http://localhost:8080/dbconsole* in a browser. The URI can be configured using the `grails.dbconsole.urlRoot` attribute in `application.groovy` and defaults to `'/dbconsole'`.

The console is enabled by default in development mode and can be disabled or enabled in other environments by using the `grails.dbconsole.enabled` attribute in `application.groovy`. For example, you could enable the console in production like this:

[source,groovy]
----
environments {
    production {
        grails.serverURL = "http://www.changeme.com"
        grails.dbconsole.enabled = true
        grails.dbconsole.urlRoot = '/admin/dbconsole'
    }
    development {
        grails.serverURL = "http://localhost:8080/${appName}"
    }
    test {
        grails.serverURL = "http://localhost:8080/${appName}"
    }
}
----

WARNING: If you enable the console in production be sure to guard access to it using a trusted security framework.


==== Configuration


By default the console is configured for an H2 database which will work with the default settings if you haven't configured an external database - you just need to change the JDBC URL to `jdbc:h2:mem:devDb`. If you've configured an external database (e.g. MySQL, Oracle, etc.) then you can use the Saved Settings dropdown to choose a settings template and fill in the url and username/password information from your `application.groovy`.
