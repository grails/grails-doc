The actual `dataSource` bean is wrapped in a transaction-aware proxy so you will be given the connection that's being used by the current transaction or Hibernate `Session` if one is active.

If this were not the case, then retrieving a connection from the `dataSource` would be a new connection, and you wouldn't be able to see changes that haven't been committed yet (assuming you have a sensible transaction isolation setting, e.g. `READ_COMMITTED` or better).

The "real" unproxied `dataSource` is still available to you if you need access to it; its bean name is `dataSourceUnproxied`.

You can access this bean like any other Spring bean, i.e. using dependency injection:

[source,groovy]
----
class MyService {

   def dataSourceUnproxied
   ...
}
----

or by pulling it from the `ApplicationContext`:

[source,groovy]
----
def dataSourceUnproxied = ctx.dataSourceUnproxied
----
