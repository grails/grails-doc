The `Application` class also implements the http://docs.grails.org/latest/api/grails/core/GrailsApplicationLifeCycle.html[GrailsApplicationLifeCycle] interface which all plugins implement.

This means that the `Application` class can be used to perform the same functions as a plugin. You can override the link:plugins.html#hookingIntoRuntimeConfiguration[regular plugins hooks] such as `doWithSpring`, `doWithApplicationContext` and so on by overriding the appropriate method:

[source,groovy]
----
class Application extends GrailsAutoConfiguration {
    @Override
    Closure doWithSpring() {
        {->
            mySpringBean(MyType)
        }
    }

    ...
}
----
