There are several ways to execute the `Application` class, if you are using an IDE then you can simply right click on the class and run it directly from your IDE which will start your Grails application.

This is also useful for debugging since you can debug directly from the IDE without having to connect a remote debugger when using the `run-app --debug-jvm` command from the command line.

You can also package your application into a runnable WAR file, for example:

[source,groovy]
----
$ grails package
$ java -jar build/libs/myapp-0.1.war
----

This is useful if you plan to deploy your application using a container-less approach.
