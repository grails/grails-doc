By default the user locale is detected from the incoming `Accept-Language` header. However, you can provide users the capability to switch locales by simply passing a parameter called `lang` to Grails as a request parameter:

[source,java]
----
/book/list?lang=es
----

Grails will automatically switch the user's locale and store it in a cookie so subsequent requests will have the new header.
