Grails link:scaffolding.html[scaffolding] templates for controllers and views are fully i18n-aware. The GSPs use the link:{gspdocs}/ref/Tags/message.html[message] tag for labels, buttons etc. and controller `flash` messages use i18n to resolve locale-specific messages.

The scaffolding includes locale specific labels for domain classes and domain fields. For example, if you have a `Book` domain class with a `title` field:

[source,groovy]
----
class Book {
    String title
}
----

The scaffolding will use labels with the following keys:

[source,groovy]
----
book.label = Libro
book.title.label = Título del libro
----

You can use this property pattern if you'd like or come up with one of your own. There is nothing special about the use of the word `label` as part of the key other than it's the convention used by the scaffolding.
