You can still use GORM validation even if you use a Java domain model. Grails lets you define constraints through separate scripts in the `src/main/groovy/` directory. The script must be in a directory that matches the package of the corresponding domain class and its name must have a _Constraints_ suffix. For example, if you had a domain class `org.example.Book`, then you would create the script `src/main/groovy/org/example/BookConstraints.groovy`\.

Add a standard GORM `constraints` block to the script:
[source,groovy]
----
constraints = {
    title blank: false
    author blank: false
}
----

Once this is in place you can validate instances of your domain class!
