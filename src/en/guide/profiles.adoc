When you create a Grails application with the link:../ref/Command%20Line/create-app.html[create-app] command by default the "web" profile is used:

[source,groovy]
----
grails create-app myapp
----

You can specify a different profile with the profile argument:

[source,groovy]
----
grails create-app myapp --profile=rest-api
----

Profiles encapsulate the project commands, templates and plugins that are designed to work for a given profile. The source for the profiles can be found https://github.com/grails-profiles[on Github], whilst the profiles themselves are published as JAR files to the Grails central repository.

To find out what profiles are available use the link:../ref/Command%20Line/list-profiles.html[list-profiles] command:

[source,groovy]
----
$ grails list-profiles
----

For more information on a particular profile use the link:../ref/Command%20Line/profile-info.html[profile-info] command:

[source,groovy]
----
$ grails profile-info rest-api
----



==== Profile Repositories


By default Grails will resolve profiles from the <<ref-orggrailscoreorggrailsprofiles-Grails central repository,Grails central repository>>. However, you can override what repositories will be searched by specifying repositories in the `USER_HOME/.grails/settings.groovy` file.

If you want profiles to be resolved with a custom repository in addition to the Grails central repository, you must specify Grails central in the file as well:

[source,groovy]
----
grails {
  profiles {
    repositories {
      myRepo {
        url = "http://foo.com/repo"
        snapshotsEnabled = true
      }
      grailsCentral {
        url = "https://repo.grails.org/grails/core"
        snapshotsEnabled = true
      }
    }
  }
}
----

NOTE: Note that Grails uses Aether to resolve profiles, as a Gradle instance is not yet available when the `create-app` command is executed. This means that you can also define repositories and more advanced configuration (proxies, authentication etc.) in your `USER_HOME/.m2/settings.xml` file if you wish.

It is also possible to store simple credentials for profile repositories directly in the `USER_HOME/.grails/settings.groovy` file.

[source,groovy]
----
grails {
  profiles {
    repositories {
      myRepo {
        url = "http://foo.com/repo"
        snapshotsEnabled = true
        username = "user"
        password = "pass"
      }
      ...
    }
  }
}
----


==== Profile Defaults


To create an application that uses a custom profile, you must specify the full artifact.

[source,groovy]
----
$ grails create-app myapp --profile=com.mycompany.grails.profiles:myprofile:1.0.0
----

To make this process easier, you can define defaults for a given profile in the `USER_HOME/grails/settings.groovy` file.

[source,groovy]
----
grails {
  profiles {
    myprofile {
      groupId = "com.mycompany.grails.profiles"
      version = "1.0.0"
    }
    repositories {
      ...
    }
  }
}
----

With the default values specified, the command to create an application using that profile becomes:

[source,groovy]
----
$ grails create-app myapp --profile=myprofile
----
