Try performing some basic CRUD (Create/Read/Update/Delete) operations.


==== Create


To create a domain class use Map constructor to set its properties and call <<ref-domain-classes-save,save>>:

[source,groovy]
----
def p = new Person(name: "Fred", age: 40, lastVisit: new Date())
p.save()
----

The <<ref-domain-classes-save,save>> method will persist your class to the database using the underlying Hibernate ORM layer.


==== Read


Grails transparently adds an implicit `id` property to your domain class which you can use for retrieval:

[source,groovy]
----
def p = Person.get(1)
assert 1 == p.id
----

This uses the <<ref-domain-classes-get,get>> method that expects a database identifier to read the `Person` object back from the database.
You can also load an object in a read-only state by using the <<ref-domain-classes-read,read>> method:

[source,java]
----
def p = Person.read(1)
----

In this case the underlying Hibernate engine will not do any dirty checking and the object will not be persisted. Note that
if you explicitly call the <<ref-domain-classes-save,save>> method then the object is placed back into a read-write state.

In addition, you can also load a proxy for an instance by using the <<ref-domain-classes-load,load>> method:

[source,java]
----
def p = Person.load(1)
----

This incurs no database access until a method other than getId() is called. Hibernate then initializes the proxied instance, or
throws an exception if no record is found for the specified id.


==== Update


To update an instance, change some properties and then call <<ref-domain-classes-save,save>> again:

[source,groovy]
----
def p = Person.get(1)
p.name = "Bob"
p.save()
----


==== Delete


To delete an instance use the <<ref-domain-classes-delete,delete>> method:

[source,groovy]
----
def p = Person.get(1)
p.delete()
----
