As well as <<gormAssociation,association>>, Grails supports the notion of composition. In this case instead of mapping classes onto separate tables a class can be "embedded" within the current table. For example:

[source,groovy]
----
class Person {
    Address homeAddress
    Address workAddress
    static embedded = ['homeAddress', 'workAddress']
}

class Address {
    String number
    String code
}
----

The resulting mapping would looking like this:

NOTE: If you define the `Address` class in a separate Groovy file in the `grails-app/domain` directory you will also get an `address` table. If you don't want this to happen use Groovy's ability to define multiple classes per file and include the `Address` class below the `Person` class in the `grails-app/domain/Person.groovy` file
