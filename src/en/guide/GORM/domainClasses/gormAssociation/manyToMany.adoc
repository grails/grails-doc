Grails supports many-to-many relationships by defining a `hasMany` on both sides of the relationship and having a `belongsTo` on the owned side of the relationship:

[source,groovy]
----
class Book {
    static belongsTo = Author
    static hasMany = [authors:Author]
    String title
}
----

[source,groovy]
----
class Author {
    static hasMany = [books:Book]
    String name
}
----

Grails maps a many-to-many using a join table at the database level. The owning side of the relationship, in this case `Author`, takes responsibility for persisting the relationship and is the only side that can cascade saves across.

For example this will work and cascade saves:

[source,groovy]
----
new Author(name:"Stephen King")
        .addToBooks(new Book(title:"The Stand"))
        .addToBooks(new Book(title:"The Shining"))
        .save()
----

However this will only save the `Book` and not the authors!

[source,groovy]
----
new Book(name:"Groovy in Action")
        .addToAuthors(new Author(name:"Dierk Koenig"))
        .addToAuthors(new Author(name:"Guillaume Laforge"))
        .save()
----

This is the expected behaviour as, just like Hibernate, only one side of a many-to-many can take responsibility for managing the relationship.

WARNING: Grails' link:scaffolding.html[scaffolding] feature *does not* currently support many-to-many relationship and hence you must write the code to manage the relationship yourself
