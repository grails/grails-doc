The `where` method, introduced in Grails 2.0, builds on the support for <<detachedCriteria,Detached Criteria>> by providing an enhanced, compile-time checked query DSL for common queries. The `where` method is more flexible than dynamic finders, less verbose than criteria and provides a powerful mechanism to compose queries.


==== Basic Querying


The `where` method accepts a closure that looks very similar to Groovy's regular collection methods. The closure should define the logical criteria in regular Groovy syntax, for example:

[source,groovy]
----
def query = Person.where {
   firstName == "Bart"
}
Person bart = query.find()
----

The returned object is a `DetachedCriteria` instance, which means it is not associated with any particular database connection or session. This means you can use the `where` method to define common queries at the class level:

[source,groovy]
----
class Person {
    static simpsons = where {
         lastName == "Simpson"
    }
    ...
}
...
Person.simpsons.each {
    println it.firstname
}
----

Query execution is lazy and only happens upon usage of the <<detachedCriteria,DetachedCriteria>> instance. If you want to execute a where-style query immediately there are variations of the `findAll` and `find` methods to accomplish this:

[source,groovy]
----
def results = Person.findAll {
     lastName == "Simpson"
}
def results = Person.findAll(sort:"firstName") {
     lastName == "Simpson"
}
Person p = Person.find { firstName == "Bart" }
----

Each Groovy operator maps onto a regular criteria method. The following table provides a map of Groovy operators to methods:

[format="csv", options="header"]
|===

Operator,Criteria Method,Description
*==*,eq,Equal to
*!=*,ne,Not equal to
*>*,gt,Greater than
*<*,lt,Less than
*>=*,ge,Greater than or equal to
*<=*,le,Less than or equal to
*in*,inList,Contained within the given list
*==~*,like,Like a given string
*=~*,ilike,Case insensitive like
|===

It is possible use regular Groovy comparison operators and logic to formulate complex queries:

[source,groovy]
----
def query = Person.where {
    (lastName != "Simpson" && firstName != "Fred") || (firstName == "Bart" && age > 9)
}
def results = query.list(sort:"firstName")
----

The Groovy regex matching operators map onto like and ilike queries unless the expression on the right hand side is a `Pattern` object, in which case they map onto an `rlike` query:

[source,groovy]
----
def query = Person.where {
     firstName ==~ ~/B.+/
}
----

NOTE: Note that `rlike` queries are only supported if the underlying database supports regular expressions

A `between` criteria query can be done by combining the `in` keyword with a range:

[source,groovy]
----
def query = Person.where {
     age in 18..65
}
----

Finally, you can do `isNull` and `isNotNull` style queries by using `null` with regular comparison operators:

[source,groovy]
----
def query = Person.where {
     middleName == null
}
----




==== Query Composition


Since the return value of the `where` method is a <<detachedCriteria,DetachedCriteria>> instance you can compose new queries from the original query:

[source,groovy]
----
def query = Person.where {
     lastName == "Simpson"
}
def bartQuery = query.where {
     firstName == "Bart"
}
Person p = bartQuery.find()
----

Note that you cannot pass a closure defined as a variable into the `where` method unless it has been explicitly cast to a `DetachedCriteria` instance. In other words the following will produce an error:

[source,groovy]
----
def callable = {
    lastName == "Simpson"
}
def query = Person.where(callable)
---- 

The above must be written as follows:

[source,groovy]
----
import grails.gorm.DetachedCriteria

def callable = {
    lastName == "Simpson"
} as DetachedCriteria<Person>
def query = Person.where(callable)
----

As you can see the closure definition is cast (using the Groovy `as` keyword) to a <<detachedCriteria,DetachedCriteria>> instance targeted at the `Person` class.


==== Conjunction, Disjunction and Negation


As mentioned previously you can combine regular Groovy logical operators (`||` and `&&`) to form conjunctions and disjunctions:

[source,groovy]
----
def query = Person.where {
    (lastName != "Simpson" && firstName != "Fred") || (firstName == "Bart" && age > 9)
}
----

You can also negate a logical comparison using `!`:

[source,groovy]
----
def query = Person.where {
    firstName == "Fred" && !(lastName == 'Simpson')
}
----


==== Property Comparison Queries


If you use a property name on both the left hand and right side of a comparison expression then the appropriate property comparison criteria is automatically used:

[source,groovy]
----
def query = Person.where {
   firstName == lastName
}
----

The following table described how each comparison operator maps onto each criteria property comparison method:

[format="csv", options="header"]
|===

Operator,Criteria Method,Description
*==*,eqProperty,Equal to
*!=*,neProperty,Not equal to
*>*,gtProperty,Greater than
*<*,ltProperty,Less than
*>=*,geProperty,Greater than or equal to
*<=*,leProperty,Less than or equal to
|===


==== Querying Associations


Associations can be queried by using the dot operator to specify the property name of the association to be queried:

[source,groovy]
----
def query = Pet.where {
    owner.firstName == "Joe" || owner.firstName == "Fred"
}
----

You can group multiple criterion inside a closure method call where the name of the method matches the association name:

[source,groovy]
----
def query = Person.where {
    pets { name == "Jack" || name == "Joe" }
}
----

This technique can be combined with other top-level criteria:

[source,groovy]
----
def query = Person.where {
     pets { name == "Jack" } || firstName == "Ed"
}
----

For collection associations it is possible to apply queries to the size of the collection:

[source,groovy]
----
def query = Person.where {
       pets.size() == 2
}
----

The following table shows which operator maps onto which criteria method for each size() comparison:

[format="csv", options="header"]
|===

Operator,Criteria Method,Description
*==*,sizeEq,The collection size is equal to
*!=*,sizeNe,The collection size is not equal to
*>*,sizeGt,The collection size is greater than
*<*,sizeLt,The collection size is less than
*>=*,sizeGe,The collection size is greater than or equal to
*<=*,sizeLe,The collection size is less than or equal to
|===



==== Subqueries


It is possible to execute subqueries within where queries. For example to find all the people older than the average age the following query can be used:

[source,groovy]
----
final query = Person.where {
  age > avg(age)
}
----

The following table lists the possible subqueries:

[format="csv", options="header"]
|===

Method,Description
*avg*,The average of all values
*sum*,The sum of all values
*max*,The maximum value
*min*,The minimum value
*count*,The count of all values
*property*,Retrieves a property of the resulting entities
|===

You can apply additional criteria to any subquery by using the `of` method and passing in a closure containing the criteria:

[source,groovy]
----
def query = Person.where {
  age > avg(age).of { lastName == "Simpson" } && firstName == "Homer"
}
----

Since the `property` subquery returns multiple results, the criterion used compares all results. For example the following query will find all people younger than people with the surname "Simpson":

[source,groovy]
----
Person.where {
    age < property(age).of { lastName == "Simpson" }
}
----



==== More Advanced Subqueries in GORM


The support for subqueries has been extended. You can now use in  with nested subqueries

[source,groovy]
----
def results = Person.where {
    firstName in where { age < 18 }.firstName
}.list()
----

Criteria and where queries can be seamlessly mixed:

[source,groovy]
----
def results = Person.withCriteria {
    notIn "firstName", Person.where { age < 18 }.firstName
 }
----

Subqueries can be used with projections:

[source,groovy]
----
def results = Person.where {
    age > where { age > 18 }.avg('age')
}
----

Correlated queries that span two domain classes can be used:
[source,groovy]
----
def employees = Employee.where {
    region.continent in ['APAC', "EMEA"]
    }.id()
    def results = Sale.where {
    employee in employees && total > 100000
    }.employee.list()
----

And support for aliases (cross query references) using simple variable declarations has been added to where queries:
[source,groovy]
----
def query = Employee.where {
    def em1 = Employee
    exists Sale.where {
        def s1 = Sale
        def em2 = employee
        return em2.id == em1.id
    }.id()
}
def results = query.list()
----



==== Other Functions


There are several functions available to you within the context of a query. These are summarized in the table below:

[format="csv", options="header"]
|===

Method,Description
*second*,The second of a date property
*minute*,The minute of a date property
*hour*,The hour of a date property
*day*,The day of the month of a date property
*month*,The month of a date property
*year*,The year of a date property
*lower*,Converts a string property to upper case
*upper*,Converts a string property to lower case
*length*,The length of a string property
*trim*,Trims a string property
|===

NOTE: Currently functions can only be applied to properties or associations of domain classes. You cannot, for example, use a function on a result of a subquery.

For example the following query can be used to find all pet's born in 2011:

[source,groovy]
----
def query = Pet.where {
    year(birthDate) == 2011
}
----

You can also apply functions to associations:

[source,groovy]
----
def query = Person.where {
    year(pets.birthDate) == 2009
}
----



==== Batch Updates and Deletes


Since each `where` method call returns a <<detachedCriteria,DetachedCriteria>> instance, you can use `where` queries to execute batch operations such as batch updates and deletes. For example, the following query will update all people with the surname "Simpson" to have the surname "Bloggs":

[source,groovy]
----
def query = Person.where {
    lastName == 'Simpson'
}
int total = query.updateAll(lastName:"Bloggs")
----

NOTE: One limitation in regards to batch operations is that join queries (queries that query associations) are not allowed.

To batch delete records you can use the `deleteAll` method:

[source,groovy]
----
def query = Person.where {
    lastName == 'Simpson'
}
int total = query.deleteAll()
----
