A domain class can be created with the <<ref-command-line-create-domain-class,create-domain-class>> command:

[source,groovy]
----
grails create-domain-class myapp.Person
----

NOTE: If no package is specified with the create-domain-class script, Grails automatically uses the application name as the package name.

This will create a class at the location `grails-app/domain/myapp/Person.groovy` such as the one below:

[source,groovy]
----
package myapp

class Person {
}
----

NOTE: If you have the `dbCreate` property set to "update", "create" or "create-drop" on your link:conf.html#dataSource[DataSource], Grails will automatically generate/modify the database tables for you.

You can customize the class by adding properties:

[source,groovy]
----
class Person {
    String name
    Integer age
    Date lastVisit
}
----

Once you have a domain class try and manipulate it with the <<ref-command-line-shell,shell>> or <<ref-command-line-console,console>> by typing:

[source,groovy]
----
grails console
----

This loads an interactive GUI where you can run Groovy commands with access to the Spring ApplicationContext, GORM, etc.
