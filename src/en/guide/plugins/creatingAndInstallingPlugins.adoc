==== Creating Plugins


Creating a Grails plugin is a simple matter of running the command:

[source,groovy]
----
grails create-plugin <<PLUGIN NAME>>
----

This will create a web-plugin project for the name you specify. For example running `grails create-plugin example` would create a new web-plugin project called `example`.

In Grails 3.0 you should consider whether the plugin you create requires a web environment or whether the plugin can be used with other profiles. If your plugin does not require a web environment then use the "plugin" profile instead of the default "web-plugin" profile:

[source,groovy]
----
grails create-plugin <<PLUGIN NAME>> --profile=plugin
----

Make sure the plugin name does not contain more than one capital letter in a row, or it won't work. Camel case is fine, though.

Being a regular Grails project has a number of benefits in that you can immediately test your plugin by running (if the plugin targets the "web" profile):

[source,shell]
----
./gradlew bootRun
----

NOTE: Plugin projects don't provide an index.gsp by default since most plugins don't need it. So, if you try to view the plugin running in a browser right after creating it, you will receive a page not found error. You can easily create a `grails-app/views/index.gsp` for your plugin if you'd like.

The structure of a Grails plugin is very nearly the same as a Grails application project's except that in the `src/main/groovy` directory under the plugin package structure you will find a plugin descriptor class (a class that ends in "GrailsPlugin"). For example:

[source,groovy]
----
import grails.plugins.*

class ExampleGrailsPlugin extends Plugin {
   ...
}
----

All plugins must have this class under the `src/main/groovy` directory, otherwise they are not regarded as a plugin. The plugin class defines metadata about the plugin, and optionally various hooks into plugin extension points (covered shortly).

You can also provide additional information about your plugin using several special properties:

* `title` - short one-sentence description of your plugin
* `grailsVersion` - The version range of Grails that the plugin supports. eg. "1.2 > *" (indicating 1.2 or higher)
* `author` - plugin author's name
* `authorEmail` - plugin author's contact e-mail
* `developers` - Any additional developers beyond the author specified above.
* `description` - full multi-line description of plugin's features
* `documentation` - URL of the plugin's documentation
* `license` - License of the plugin
* `issueManagement` - Issue Tracker of the plugin
* `scm` - Source code management location of the plugin

Here is a slimmed down example from the https://github.com/grails-plugins/grails-quartz[Quartz Grails plugin]:

[source,groovy]
----
package quartz

@Slf4j
class QuartzGrailsPlugin extends Plugin {
    // the version or versions of Grails the plugin is designed for
    def grailsVersion = "3.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT > *"
    // resources that are excluded from plugin packaging
    def pluginExcludes = [
            "grails-app/views/error.gsp"
    ]
    def title = "Quartz" // Headline display name of the plugin
    def author = "Jeff Brown"
    def authorEmail = "zzz@yyy.com"
    def description = '''\
Adds Quartz job scheduling features
'''
    def profiles = ['web']
    List loadAfter = ['hibernate3', 'hibernate4', 'hibernate5', 'services']
    def documentation = "http://grails.org/plugin/quartz"
    def license = "APACHE"
    def issueManagement = [ system: "Github Issues", url: "http://github.com/grails3-plugins/quartz/issues" ]
    def developers = [
            [ name: "Joe Dev", email: "joedev@gmail.com" ]
    ]
    def scm = [ url: "https://github.com/grails3-plugins/quartz/" ]

==== Plugin Configuration

Instead of directly accessing Grails configuration as `grailsApplication.config.getProperty('mail.hostName', String)`, use a Spring Boot configuration bean (or a POJO) annotated with {springbootapi}/org/springframework/boot/context/properties/ConfigurationProperties.html[ConfigurationProperties] annotation. Here is an example plugin configuration:

_./src/main/groovy/example/MailPluginConfiguration.groovy_
[source,groovy]
```
package example

import org.springframework.boot.context.properties.ConfigurationProperties

@ConfigurationProperties(prefix = "mail")
class MailPluginConfiguration {

    String hostName
    int port
    String from
}

```

You can inject the `MailPluginConfiguration` bean into your bean like any other bean.

_./grails-app/services/example/MailService.groovy_
[source,groovy]
```
package example

class MailService {

    MailPluginConfiguration mailPluginConfiguration

    void sendMail() {

    }

}
```

Please read the {springBootReference}/html/features.html#features.external-config[Spring Boot Externalized Configuration] section for more information.

==== Installing Local Plugins

In order to install the Grails plugin to your local Maven, you could use Gradle https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/publishing_maven.html[Maven Publish] plugin. You may also need to configure the publishing extension as:

[source,groovy]
----
publishing {
    publications {
        maven(MavenPublication) {
            versionMapping {
                usage('java-api') {
                    fromResolutionOf('runtimeClasspath')
                }
                usage('java-runtime') {
                    fromResolutionResult()
                }
            }
            from components.java
        }
    }
}
----

NOTE: Please refer to the Gradle Maven Publish plugin documentation for up-to-date information.

To make your plugin available for use in a Grails application run the `./gradlew publishToMavenLocal` command:

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew publishToMavenLocal
----

This will install the plugin into your local Maven cache. Then to use the plugin within an application declare a dependency on the plugin in your `build.gradle` file and include `mavenLocal()` in your repositories hash:

[source,groovy]
----
...
repositories {
    ...
    mavenLocal()
}
...
implementation "org.grails.plugins:quartz:0.1"
----

NOTE: In Grails 2.x plugins were packaged as ZIP files, however in Grails 3.x plugins are simple JAR files that can be added to the classpath of the IDE.



==== Plugins and Multi-Project Builds


If you wish to setup a plugin as part of a multi project build then follow these steps.

*Step 1: Create the application and the plugin*

Using the `grails` command create an application and a plugin:

[source,groovy]
----
$ grails create-app myapp
$ grails create-plugin myplugin
----

*Step 2: Create a settings.gradle file*

In the same directory create a `settings.gradle` file with the following contents:

[source,groovy]
----
include "myapp", "myplugin"
----

The directory structure should be as follows:

[source,groovy]
----
PROJECT_DIR
  - settings.gradle
  - myapp
    - build.gradle
  - myplugin
    - build.gradle
----

*Step 3: Declare a project dependency on the plugin*

Within the `build.gradle` of the application declare a dependency on the plugin within the `plugins` block:

[source,groovy]
----
grails {
    plugins {
        implementation project(':myplugin')
    }
}
----

NOTE: You can also declare the dependency within the `dependencies` block, however you will not get subproject reloading if you do this!

*Step 4: Configure the plugin to enable reloading*

In the plugin directory, add or modify the `gradle.properties` file. A new property `exploded=true` needs to be set in order for the plugin to add the exploded directories to the classpath.

*Step 5: Run the application*

Now run the application using the `./gradlew bootRun` command from the root of the application directory, you can use the `verbose` flag to see the Gradle output:

[source,groovy]
----
$ cd myapp
$ ./gradlew bootRun --verbose
----

You will notice from the Gradle output that plugins sources are built and placed on the classpath of your application:

[source,groovy]
----
:myplugin:compileAstJava UP-TO-DATE
:myplugin:compileAstGroovy UP-TO-DATE
:myplugin:processAstResources UP-TO-DATE
:myplugin:astClasses UP-TO-DATE
:myplugin:compileJava UP-TO-DATE
:myplugin:configScript UP-TO-DATE
:myplugin:compileGroovy
:myplugin:copyAssets UP-TO-DATE
:myplugin:copyCommands UP-TO-DATE
:myplugin:copyTemplates UP-TO-DATE
:myplugin:processResources
:myapp:compileJava UP-TO-DATE
:myapp:compileGroovy
:myapp:processResources UP-TO-DATE
:myapp:classes
:myapp:findMainClass
:myapp:bootRun
Grails application running at http://localhost:8080 in environment: development
----


==== Notes on excluded Artefacts


Although the link:../ref/Command%20Line/create-plugin.html[create-plugin] command creates certain files for you so that the plugin can be run as a Grails application, not all of these files are included when packaging a plugin. The following is a list of artefacts created, but not included by link:../ref/Command%20Line/package-plugin.html[package-plugin]:

* `grails-app/build.gradle` (although it is used to generate `dependencies.groovy`)
* `grails-app/conf/application.yml` (renamed to plugin.yml)
* `grails-app/conf/spring/resources.groovy`
* `grails-app/conf/logback.groovy`
* Everything within `/src/test/\*\*`
* SCM management files within `\*\*/.svn/\*\*` and `\*\*/CVS/\*\*`


==== Customizing the plugin contents


When developing a plugin you may create test classes and sources that are used during the development and testing of the plugin but should not be exported to the application.

To exclude test sources you need to modify the `pluginExcludes` property of the plugin descriptor AND exclude the resources inside your `build.gradle` file. For example say you have some classes under the `com.demo` package that are in your plugin source tree but should not be packaged in the application. In your plugin descriptor you should exclude these:

[source,groovy]
----
// resources that should be loaded by the plugin once installed in the application
  def pluginExcludes = [
    '**/com/demo/**'
  ]
----

And in your `build.gradle` you should exclude the compiled classes from the JAR file:

[source,groovy]
----
jar {
  exclude "com/demo/**/**"
}
----



==== Inline Plugins in Grails 3.0


In Grails 2.x it was possible to specify inline plugins in `BuildConfig`, in Grails 3.x this functionality has been replaced by Gradle's multi-project build feature.

To set up a multi project build create an appliation and a plugin in a parent directory:

[source,groovy]
----
$ grails create-app myapp
$ grails create-plugin myplugin
----

Then create a `settings.gradle` file in the parent directory specifying the location of your application and plugin:

[source,groovy]
----
include 'myapp', 'myplugin'
----

Finally add a dependency in your application's `build.gradle` on the plugin:

[source,groovy]
----
implementation project(':myplugin')
----

Using this technique you have achieved the equivalent of inline plugins from Grails 2.x.
