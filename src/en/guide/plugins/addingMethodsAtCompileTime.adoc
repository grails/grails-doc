Grails 3.0 makes it easy to add new traits to existing artefact types from a plugin. For example say you wanted to add methods for manipulating dates to controllers. This can be done by defining a trait in `src/main/groovy`:

[source,groovy]
----
package myplugin

@Enhances("Controller")
trait DateTrait {
  Date currentDate() {
    return new Date()
  }
}
----

The `@Enhances` annotation defines the types of artefacts that the trait should be applied to.

As an alternative to using the `@Enhances` annotation above, you can implement a http://docs.grails.org/latest/api/grails/compiler/traits/TraitInjector.html[TraitInjector] to tell Grails which artefacts you want to inject the trait into at compile time:

[source,groovy]
----
package myplugin

@CompileStatic
class ControllerTraitInjector implements TraitInjector {

    @Override
    Class getTrait() {
        DateTrait
    }

    @Override
    String[] getArtefactTypes() {
        ['Controller'] as String[]
    }
}
----

The above `TraitInjector` will add the `DateTrait` to all controllers. The `getArtefactTypes` method defines the types of artefacts that the trait should be applied to.
