As a plugin developer, it can be important for you to find out about what domain classes, controllers, or other types of artefact are available in an application. For example, the [Searchable plugin|http://grails.org/plugin/searchable] needs to know what domain classes exist so it can check them for any @searchable@ properties and index the appropriate ones. So how does it do it? The answer lies with the @grailsApplication@ object, and instance of [GrailsApplication|api:grails.core.GrailsApplication] that's available automatically in controllers and GSPs and can be [injected|guide:dependencyInjectionServices] everywhere else.

The @grailsApplication@ object has several important properties and methods for querying artefacts. Probably the most common is the one that gives you all the classes of a particular artefact type:

{code}
for (cls in grailsApplication.<artefactType>Classes) {
    ...
}
{code}

In this case, @artefactType@ is the property name form of the artefact type. With core Grails you have:

* domain
* controller
* tagLib
* service
* codec
* bootstrap
* urlMappings

So for example, if you want to iterate over all the domain classes, you use:

{code}
for (cls in grailsApplication.domainClasses) {
    ...
}
{code}

and for URL mappings:

{code}
for (cls in grailsApplication.urlMappingsClasses) {
    ...
}
{code}

You need to be aware that the objects returned by these properties are not instances of [Class|api:java.lang.Class]. Instead, they are instances of [GrailsClass|api:grails.core.GrailsClass] that has some particularly useful properties and methods, including one for the underlying @Class@:

* @shortName@ - the class name of the artefact without the package (equivalent of @Class.simpleName@).
* @logicalPropertyName@ - the artefact name in property form without the 'type' suffix. So @MyGreatController@ becomes 'myGreat'.
* @isAbstract()@ - a boolean indicating whether the artefact class is abstract or not.
* @getPropertyValue(name)@ - returns the value of the given property, whether it's a static or an instance one. This works best if the property is initialised on declaration, e.g. @static transactional = true@.

The artefact API also allows you to fetch classes by name and check whether a class is an artefact:

* get<type>Class(String name)
* is<type>Class(Class clazz)

The first method will retrieve the @GrailsClass@ instance for the given name, e.g. 'MyGreatController'. The second will check whether a class is a particular type of artefact. For example, you can use @grailsApplication.isControllerClass(org.example.MyGreatController)@ to check whether @MyGreatController@ is in fact a controller.
