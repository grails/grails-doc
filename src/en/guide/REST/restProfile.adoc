Since Grails 3.1, Grails supports a tailored profile for creating REST applications that provides a more focused set of dependencies and commands.

To get started with a REST API-type application:

[source,console]
----
$ grails create-restapi my-api
----

This will create a new REST application that provides the following features:

* Default set of commands for creating and generating REST endpoints
* Defaults to using JSON views for rendering responses (see the next section)
* Fewer plugins than a default Grails Web-style application (no GSP, no Asset Pipeline, nothing HTML related)

You will notice for example in the `grails-app/views` directory that there are `*.gson` files for rendering the default index page and as well as any 404 and 500 errors.

If you issue the following set of commands:

[source,console]
----
$ grails create-domain-class my.api.Book
$ ./gradlew runCommand -Pargs="generate-all my.api.Book"
----

NOTE: The generate-* commands are only available after adding the `org.grails.plugins:scaffolding` dependency to your project. They are not available by default in a REST application. Also, they will no longer produce *.gson files as that was a feature of the REST API-profile. Profiles where removed in Grails 6.

Instead of CRUD HTML interface a REST endpoint is generated that produces JSON responses. In addition, the generated functional and unit tests by default test the REST endpoint.
