With modern hardware featuring multiple cores, many programming languages have been adding asynchronous, parallel programming APIs, Groovy being no exception.

Popular asynchronous libraries include:

* RxJava - http://reactivex.io
* GPars - http://gpars.org
* Reactor - https://projectreactor.io

By building on top of these various libraries the https://async.grails.org[Async features of Grails] aim to simplify concurrent programming within the framework, include the concept of Promises, and a unified event model.

In general, since the Reactive programming model is an evolving space, Grails tries to provide generic support for integrating a range of asynchronous libraries and doesn't recommend any single library as they all have various advantages and disadvantages.

For more information on Asynchronous programming with Grails see the user guide for the https://async.grails.org[Grails Asynchronous Framework].
