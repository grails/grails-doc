h2. Purpose

    }
}
{code}

h2. Description

Usage: @version(string/boolean)@

By default GORM is configured with [optimistic locking|guide:locking] enabled. You can disable optimistic locking by calling the @version@ method with an argument of @false@:

{code}
static mapping = {
    version false
}
{code}

Alternatively if you simply want to change the column used to store the version you can pass the name of the column:

{code}
static mapping = {
    version 'revision_number'
}
{code}

The @timestamp@ type is also supported by Grails:

{code}
class Book {
    Timestamp version
}
{code}
