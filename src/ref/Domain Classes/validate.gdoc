h1. validate

h2. Purpose

Validates a domain class against the applied constraints (see [Validation|guide:validation])

h2. Description

The @validate@ method validates a domain class based on its defined [constraints|guide:constraints]. The errors are stored in the [errors|domainClasses] property of the domain class instance.

The @validate@ method accepts an optional @List@ argument which contains the names of the properties to be validated. When a @List@ of names is specified, only those properties will be validated.

h2. Examples

{code:java}
def b = new Book(title: "The Shining")
if (!b.validate()) {
    b.errors.each {
        println it
    }
}
{code}

{code:java}
def a = new Album(artist: "Genesis", title: "Nursery Cryme", releaseDate: 1971)

// only validate title and releaseDate
if (!a.validate(["title", "releaseDate"])) {
    a.errors.each {
        println it
    }
}
{code}

Parameters:

* @deepValidate@ (optional) - Whether associations of the domain instance should also be validated, i.e. whether validation cascades. This is @true@ by default; set it to @false@ to disable cascading validation.
