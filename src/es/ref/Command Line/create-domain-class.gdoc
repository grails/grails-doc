h1. create-domain-class

h2. Purpose

The @create-domain-class@ command creates a domain and associated integration test for the given base name.

h2. Examples

{code:java}
grails create-domain-class org.bookstore.Book
{code}

h2. Description

Creates a domain class for the given base name. For example, for a base name "org.bookstore.Book" a domain class called @Book@ will be created in the @grails-app/domain/org/bookstore@ directory.

A domain class represents the core model behind in your application and is typically mapped onto database tables. For more information on domain models in Grails refer to the chapter on [GORM|guide:GORM] in the user guide.

The exact behaviour of the command depends on the argument you pass. If you don't specify a package (like "org.bookstore" in the example), then the name of the application will be used as the package. So if the application name is "bookstore" and you run @create-domain-class Book@, then the command will create the file @grails-app/domain/bookstore/Book.groovy@. Also, if you don't give your domain class an initial capital letter, it will be capitalized for you. So an argument of "org.bookstore.book" will result in a domain class called @Book@.

Note that this command is just for convenience and you can also create domain classes in your favourite text editor or IDE if you choose.

Usage:
{code:java}
grails create-domain-class [name]
{code}

Fired Events:

* @CreatedFile@ - When the domain class is created
