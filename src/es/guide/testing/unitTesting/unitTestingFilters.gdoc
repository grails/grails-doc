Unit testing filters is typically a matter of testing a controller where a filter is a mock collaborator. For example consider the following filters class:

{code:java}
class CancellingFilters {
    def filters = {
        all(controller:"simple", action:"list") {
            before = {
                redirect(controller:"book")
                return false
            }
        }
    }
}
{code}

This filter interceptors the @list@ action of the @simple@ controller and redirects to the @book@ controller. To test this filter you start off with a test that targets the @SimpleController@ class and add the @CancellingFilters@ as a mock collaborator:

{code:java}
@TestFor(SimpleController)
@Mock(CancellingFilters)
class SimpleControllerTests {

}
{code}

You can then implement a test that uses the @withFilters@ method to wrap the call to an action in filter execution:

{code:java}
void testInvocationOfListActionIsFiltered() {
    withFilters(action:"list") {
        controller.list()
    }
    assert response.redirectedUrl == '/book'
}
{code}

Note that the @action@ parameter is required because it is unknown what the action to invoke is until the action is actually called. The @controller@ parameter is optional and taken from the controller under test. If it is a another controller you are testing then you can specify it:

{code:java}
withFilters(controller:"book",action:"list") {
    controller.list()
}
{code}
